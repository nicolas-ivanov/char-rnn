KRYPTONlTE !
Peppino , don 't make me drag you .
Come on !
Do me a favour ...
Come on .
Halt , passers- by !
Rosaria , you 're not allowed through !
Gennaro , not today , I still have to cook .
I feel it ...
I feel the vibes ...
You 've got kryptonite in your bag !
I swear on your father 's soul , I don 't have any ...
Damn the torpedoes !
Mum , give him your bag .
Fine , here ...
This is the story of a superhero , of a family , and of a little boy with glasses .
The little boy , Giuseppe Sansone , AKA Peppino , was bom in Naples on February 20 , 1964 .
Peppino 's arrival immediately caused a stir in the family .
His aunt and uncles soon began to worry about him .
Sweet Jesus , he 's so ugly ...
Titina , he 's not that ugly , he 's just particular looking .
Maybe he 's really intelligent ...
Maybe ...
Uncle Federico , although busy studying for high school , devised ways to keep his newborn nephew at bay .
That son of ours is so smart .
Indeed , Federico is so brainy .
Aunt Titina and Uncle Salvatore also concocted various techniques to keep him quiet and make him sleep .
Enough Salvatore , we don 't want to kill him .
Peppino , a ball !
His father soon tried to rouse his love for sports ... but to no avail .
His paternal grandparents raised him with their own methods .
Mum , what did you do ?
But the most crucial moment was the discovery that Peppino was myopic .
Antonio and Rosaria had never seen children with glasses .
Antonio Sansone , Peppino 's father , worked at the Singer shop in Portici , near Naples .
Antonio gave rides to other neighbourhood shopkeepers .
The Failed Boxer , Tonino ,
Gigino , the Tripe Seller , and Valeria , the Tobacconist 's Daughter .
For Peppino , sewing machines exuded an inexplicable appeal , much like his mother 's work instruments .
Rosaria Sansone had an accounting degree and worked as a typist for 70, 000 lira a month .
While her co- worker Assunta didn 't receive a thing since her salary was collected directly by her family .
Assunta had two dreams : to find a boyfriend , and buy a tube of tasty Kraft mayonnaise .
Assunta , take this home , it 's a savoury ricotta pie .
1 made it last night .
Take it home ?
Then they 'll eat it !
Spit it out !
Last but not least , cousin Gennaro , who thought he was Superman .
Gennaro feared nothing , except an evil mineral .
My mistake , you 're not transporting the lethal green kryptonite .
Sure ?
Don 't you want to X- ray me ?
Till our next adventure !
Say hi to Batman for me when you see him !
This is the story of a little boy with glasses , of a family , and of a superhero .
But it 's not a story about childhood , it 's a story about love .
When I grow up will I be like Superman ?
Hope not .
" Distinguished sirs " ...
That fast ?
What 's that ?
" Best regards " .
This is " Peppino " ..
this is " mother " .
Gabelsberger shorthand .
I was fast as lightning ,
I could 've won the national shorthand championship .
Why didn 't you do it ?
Who would 've taken care of you ?
Who would 've looked after you and bathed you ?
Time to get out or your fingers will shrivel up like a chicken 's .
Won 't your fingers shrivel up ?
Peppino , let 's play a game ... go stand near the window out there , try to spot another car that 's the same exact colour as ours .
That 's really hard !
That 's why this game is fun !
If you win , you get 500 lira .
Dry off first .
How dare you !
Missed shot by player 11 , Ferradini ...
Peppino , ask dad and grandpa if they want coffee .
Go on .
Grandma wants to know ...
Shh !
The match is on !
Peppino !
Dad ...
The match !
Give us this day our daily bread , forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us .
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil , amen .
And remember each of you has three mothers .
The first mum : who does the cooking and cleaning at home .
The second : who 's up in heaven , our beloved Virgin Mary .
And the third ... is me , your teacher that the good Lord gave you .
That said , place your hands on your desks and let 's begin parsing sentences ...
" A man went to the market . "
" A " ?
Indefinite article !
Good , Peppino .
" Man " ?
Common noun .
' Went " ?
From the verb " to go " , past tense , third person singular
' To " ?
Imposimato , give it a try ...
Definite article ?
Imposimato , you 're making me crazy !
Give it another try ...
" To " ?
Adjective ?
An adjective ?
" To " ?
How could that be an adjective ?
Come on , think it through . â€¢ To " ...
Pre ...
Prep ...
Quiet !
Preposition .
What kind of preposition ?
Don 't cry , I had to tell you the answer !
" Market " ?
What about me ?
Be the goal .
The goalie ?
No , the goalpost .
No goal , it hit the post !
Peppino ... something happened , something horrible happened .
Gennaro , your cousin , Superman , is gone ... he was run over by the 111 bus ...
He died , Peppino .
But Superman can 't just die .
No ?
He never dies ... unless the bus was full of kryptonite ... that evil mineral !
Lex Luthor put it there !
Well , maybe he really did put it there .
How about we go to the fair on Sunday ?
And maybe one of these days we 'll go to Procida .
It 's a wonderful island .
Well take the ferry .
Me , you , and daddy .
Yes !
Don 't run , you 'll get hurt .
ROSARlA BEWARE , ANTONlO 'S " CHEETlNG " ON YOU
Come to daddy ...
Rosaria , it 's late , I have to go .
See you later .
Bye .
Why didn 't you invite him , we could 've finally met him .
At a funeral ?
Plus , I 'm not dating Raffaele anymore , I don 't talk to him .
Already over ?
You were only together for 2 months .
Only ?
For me 2 months is already too much !
He 's your fifth boyfriend this year !
I 'm free to choose , and to choose I have to try .
I only had one boyfriend , and it worked out fine for me .
You 're restless , always dating then dumping one after another .
Times have changed , things have changed , even relationships between men and women .
We 're all free to follow our own path .
Can you explain how this path of yours is any different from the path of a whore ?
Peppino ?
He 's sad .
He always seems sad .
I bought him a gift .
Antonio , the gift is moving .
Peppino , this is what life is like : you lost Gennaro today ... but life goes on , it 's reborn , it never stops ...
Understand ?
Life is stronger than death .
Thanks dad !
Understand ?
Yes .
Say it for daddy .
Life is stronger than death .
Good boy !
You have three new friends as of today : this is First , this is Second , and this one 's called Third .
Dad , are they all right ?
Maybe you should 've put holes in the box ...
Hurry , go get some Micorex from mum .
You 're the symbol of rebirth , don 't make me look like a jerk !
Come on !
Hurry , Peppino !
Hello ?
Who is it ?
Mum 's not here ?
Of course she is .
Rosaria ?
Rosaria , what happened ?
Nothing .
I don 't feel right .
I have a bad headache .
Come eat with us .
Antonio , leave me be .
I want to be alone .
Want me to bring you something ?
I need to rest .
Take care of Peppino .
Is there any salad ?
No , tomorrow ...
Bread ?
I don 't think we have any .
Check the bread box .
Carmela , your daughter ?
It 's now 5 days and she 's still not well .
What 's wrong with Rosaria ?
She has a bad headache .
We thought it was due to the change of seasons , but no ... 5 days is a lot , there must be a reason .
Last year , my daughter Patrizia got her hair highlighted , then she was bedridden for a week .
She said it was due to the radiation in the heat lamp .
No hairdresser 's involved here , Rosaria 's not well .
Put potato slices on her forehead .
Peppino , you 're here too ...
Mum 's ill , she has a bad headache .
I heard , I 'm sorry .
She 'll be fine in 2- 3 days , and things will go back to normal .
Hope so .
Well , 2- 3 days is quite a long time ...
Peppino , did you finish your homework ?
I have one math problem left : if I have 1, 000 lira and lend 300 ...
You don 't have 1, 000 lira , do you ?
No , it 's just a math problem ...
Okay , but would you like to get 1, 000 lira ?
Sure .
Then go outside and if you spot a car the same colour as ours , you 'll win 1, 000 lira !
What a sorry sight ...
Put on some make- up , you 're as pale as a ghost .
I 'm sure they 've seen worse at the hospital .
Hospital ?
Don 't worry , it 's just for some tests .
So we can find out what 's wrong .
Finish eating and I 'll take you to school .
Be good .
When are we going home ?
Assunta ...
I 'm cold , let 's go home !
Don 't start ...
1 need to find a boyfriend .
You have to find one here ?
Where else , in the city streets ?
If he sees my clothes , he 'll realise I 'm dirt poor .
At least here in a bathing suit , rich and poor look alike .
Got it ?
Turn around ...
Turn around ...
Turn around ...
Turn around ...
Is that Procida ?
No , you can 't see it from here .
Stop talking now .
Keep to yourself , I 'll keep to myself .
Move along ...
A fisherman , that 's all I need .
Not bad after all ...
Let 's see ...
Will Franco Bebi ask me out ?
Yes !
See ?
I knew it !
Your turn , what do you want to know ?
Dunno ...
Then I 'll ask for you .
Will Peppino become a hunk that all the girls fall for ?
Yes !
I have a feeling this system can 't be accurate .
Rosaria , you can tell me what 's wrong .
I have a headache .
That 's all ?
If it were something else , would you tell me ?
Of course I would , then you could take care of it .
Maybe all these books are bad for you .
You read too much .
Salvatore , let me get some sleep ...
Get going .
My point , I win !
Oh what fun ...
No luck , she won 't talk , she won 't see anyone .
All right , let 's go .
A man with make- up , how odd !
Peppino , odd is cool , it 's fashionable .
Bye .
Bye .
Gennaro , so you 're not dead !
Who said such nonsense ?
Mum , dad , everyone ...
I even saw your funeral notices .
People talk just to talk , ignore them !
You got run over by a bus .
Peppino , think about it ...
Do you think a simple city bus could possibly kill me ?
I came to see you because you know I 'm not a mere mortal .
You believe in my superpowers !
So you really are Superman ?
Yes , I am Superman .
A Neapolitan Superman .
Do you mind if I smoke ?
I learned how to make smoke rings , I don 't feel like it now ...
You 've changed , you never smoked before , and your hair 's different .
Because I 'm free now , more like the me I want to be .
What does that mean ?
Never mind .
I 'm here to protect you .
When you need me , call and I 'll rush over .
Unless I have a serious duty , like a robbery in Pignasecca , or if Lex Luthor , the evil genius , threatens Posillipo .
What 'll we do now ?
Nothing , what do you think ?
It 's late , go to sleep .
Sleep , I 'll keep watch over you .
Really ?
Really .
Are you sure ?
I 'm sure .
You 're really sure ?
Peppino , sleep !
Everything looks fine , even the liver .
I just don 't feel right .
He said there 's nothing wrong .
No , I said physically there 's no cause for your daughter 's headache .
Rosaria needs to rest and should start talking to someone .
Talk ?
She talks all the time , she 's a real talker .
She 's just a little bit glum now , but she talks all the time , non- stop , with me , her sister , her brothers , her husband ...
Did you like the rice casserole ?
Delicious , the first hot meal I 've had in days , been living off mozzarella , soon I 'll turn into one .
I 'm sure this mess will get sorted out ...
Rosaria doesn 't seem to care about anything anymore .
She 's sick ...
Even if she 's sick , a woman must tend to her things .
Or else it 's her own fault if her man cheats on her ... right ?
1 don 't want to think about it .
Then don 't think .
It 's not me I 'm worried about , but Peppino .
I need to find a distraction for that boy .
Shouldn 't they eat chicken feed ?
Nonsense !
He likes grandma 's onion omelette .
Second is devouring it !
Good boy , Second !
You like the omelette , huh ?
Peppino , quick !
Get the Micorex !
Quick !
I said quick !
In any case , life goes on , understand ?
Peppino , understand ?
It 's a tricky situation .
Peppino 's a problem child , he has lots of issues .
Now that Rosaria needs to rest , he needs supervision ... we have to find a solution .
Right .
So who 's going to take this child ?
His dad works , his mum 's in bed all day ... those other grandparents ...
They 're southerners , they use chairs and ropes !
We don 't like that .
Wise words , indeed .
Assunta said she can watch him on Thursday .
He can come to my house too , but he can 't just stay here .
It 's like he 's in prison !
I 'd like to help , but with my illegal cigarette stand , the transporters , the police , Patrizia ...
I 'm far too busy .
I have an idea .
Peppino needs a distraction .
Homework aside , he has the right to have some fun .
The boy is so eloquent !
I ain 't watching him because I do studying .
But Titina and Salvatore have nothing to do and are always penniless .
If you give them a little something , they 'd gladly watch him .
My son is so brainy !
I said to Elio :
" Thanks for the music , dance with us . "
He said :
" No thanks , I 'm not much of a dancer . "
Not much of a dancer indeed , he hobbles !
You 're from the Greek capital ?
Not from Athens but I 'm Greek .
All of us are Greek .
How come you 're here ?
To study , kind of ...
Sorry , didn 't mean to wake you .
Pity about these glasses ... you 'd be cute without them .
Thanks a lot .
You know I love you , right ?
Yes , I know .
I love you too .
You 're a strong boy .
You 'll pull through in any case .
Why " in any case " ?
No reason .
Go to sleep , it 's late .
Sleep , my darling .
Mrs. Sansone ?
So ...
Rosaria Sansone , age 38 , married , with a 9- year- old son .
Correct ?
Peppino .
Almost 10 .
Should I sit here or on the sofa ?
Whatever you prefer .
You can sit there if you 'd like .
I like the chair better .
You 're probably wondering about me .
My name is Enrico .
I 'm 42 and I was born in Naples .
But I studied outside of Naples .
I have a degree in medicine and a specialisation in psychiatry .
I 'm married but without children .
My wife and I recently moved back to Naples , to Vomero .
We live in my mother 's home , she died recently .
I 'm sorry .
I hope to one day open my own clinic .
I wanted to tell you a little about me before you felt obliged to talk .
Next time you can talk about anything you want ... it only seems fair since I 've told you so much about me .
Why , are we done ?
No .
But I don 't want you to feel obliged to speak , for today .
We can stop now if you don 't feel like talking .
Talking about what ?
Anything ... even the weather
It 's nice out today .
Indeed , it 's lovely .
It would be a good beach day .
You like the beach ?
Yes .
Do you go often ?
I wish , I just don 't have the time .
When I was 15 , I went to Procida for a week .
My parents sent me to visit some distant cousins .
How was it ?
I had a great time .
I swam all day .
At night we cooked fish ... on a rock , like the fishermen had taught us .
I have a photo from that holiday ...
I 'm at Ciraccio beach , wearing a one- piece bathing suit and a cone- shaped hat , goodness knows where I got it !
And I 'm looking into the camera with an expression as if saying : if I can actually wear this darn hat , who knows how far I 'll get !
But instead ...
Instead ?
Nothing .
Where are we going ?
To a very secret place .
Foxy , do you have a light ?
Uncle Salvatore 's not coming ?
No , only women are allowed .
What about me ?
You don 't count , you 're a child .
Are you Carmela ?
No .
You have a sister named Carmela ?
No .
Let 's go , Peppino .
Nobody in your family is named Carmela ?
An aunt .
1 was right !
Women endure dual oppression .
They 're oppressed by capital , and furthermore , they ... meaning us ... are oppressed by domestic slavery , suffocated by petty , humiliating , tiresome , degrading tasks .
The patriarchal family imposes maternity as our duty ...
Hop up .
Stay here , be quiet , don 't let anyone see you , promise ?
Can 't I stay with Uncle Salvatore ?
No , he 's busy .
Play the silence game , okay ?
Let 's break the vicious circle that restricts our freedom .
Let us become the masters of our own days !
In order to rebel against tradition , women burn their bras , which are symbols of a culture that limits us and constrains us .
Perhaps you don 't want to burn yours , because it 's new so that would be wasteful , then at least choose not to wear them , put them in a trunk , do what you want with them , but don 't wear them anymore !
Have you seen Gianni ?
Sorry , he 's my nephew .
Here , I got you some snacks .
I don 't have money to buy you juice .
But what 's our deal ?
1 won 't say a word to anyone .
It wasn 't anything bad , okay ?
There 's nothing wrong with it .
Those girls were naked and were kissing I
One was looking at herself with a mirror .
One had hair in between her legs and chased me !
Shh !
Don 't announce it to all of Naples , for goodness sake !
Pretend you didn 't see a thing or we 'll never take you out again .
Well ?
How did it go ?
She kept yapping and yapping , I had to give her some self knowledge .
Teacher , I need to use the bathroom .
Imposimato , go hit the books , study your prepositions .
Penalty !
Hold on !
Gennaro , how 'd you get into my school 's bathrooms ?
Superpowers .
I came because of what Fulvio Cacace did .
He broke my glasses , on purpose !
I know , Fulvio Cacace is an evil person .
Make him fall down the stairs so he gets hurt and learns a lesson .
I can 't interfere in such a trite human matter .
Then why did you come ?
1 came to bring you ... .. something more important than a petty vendetta !
I came to say that you 're right , you do the right things .
Isn 't that enough ?
Sure , it 's enough .
Good , then this mission is accomplished too .
Well , aren 't you going to say anything ?
Notice anything different ?
Not really .
Kid , you 're too focused on yourself .
That 's bad .
Look !
I painted my nails .
Classy , isn 't it ?
I 'm off , I have to meet Thor .
The Mighty Thor ?
Yes .
" Let 's meet up , Gennaro ! "
And then he just talks about his magic hammer , he 's obsessed .
Wait , Gennaro !
Did he give you pills or drops ?
Nothing .
So what exactly do you do with this Matarrese ?
We talk .
That 's it ?
Talk to me instead of going all the way to Piazza Municipio !
I knew it !
These darn chicks are in the way .
What 's wrong , are you tense ?
No , and if I were ... .. I could go chitchat with the doctor too .
Is Peppino with Assunta ?
It 's cold , can 't we go back home ?
Shut up !
Can 't you see that guy is looking at me ?
Hello sir !
Are you nuts ?
You scared him off .
Good morning .
Morning .
Is this your son ?
God no , no such thing !
He 's my friend 's son .
I look after him now and then , as a favour to her ... as a good deed .
Peppino , go buy yourself an ice cream .
With what money ?
You said you 're dirt poor .
But it 's raining .
Go , build up some antibodies .
I 'm Arturo .
" The boy from the bureau " !
Sorry , it 's from a commercial ...
I 've seen you here before .
Really ?
Do you live around here too ?
No , I 'm from the other side of town .
Why do you ask ?
Because I was hoping we could meet again .
We can meet here again , right ?
Now I have a reason to see you again .
Peppino , have you noticed that First and Third stink ?
No .
They stink ...
Here we go , now let 's get busy ...
Dad , I think Third 's scared .
That 's normal , when you were a baby ... you 'd go crazy when we tried to bathe you !
I 'd plunge your head under , you 'd cry , but then you liked it ...
Remember ?
Yes .
One , two , three !
Put the other one in too .
Dad , do baby chicks know how to swim ?
Peppino , that 's life .
Now you 're in charge of caring for the lone survivor , understand ?
Yes .
Mum ...
I 'm off .
Aunt Titina is waiting for me outside .
Can I come with you ?
Sure ... but fix yourself up , you can 't go out like that .
No , I was just kidding .
Go on , Peppino .
Have fun .
You should 've been in second gear .
I was , but the instructor said I 'd burn out the engine .
" Miss , are you going to change gears or not ? "
These dirty old men will use any excuse to touch a lady !
You should report that sleaze !
No Pasquale , I 'm not in the mood for that .
LSD is the last thing we need after a heavy meal .
What 's the name of this driving school ?
We mustn 't be ashamed of our bodies .
Have you seen Gianni ?
Have you seen Gianni ?
No !
Peppino !
Salvatore , have you seen Peppino ?
Who ?
Have you seen my nephew ?
St. Anthony ...
I swear I 'll pick one man and settle down for good ...
Please help me find Peppino !
What happened ?
My nephew 's disappeared .
That boy 's full of issues already ...
Relax , we 'll find him .
If you don 't get lost , you 'll never be found .
My name 's Elio Brandi .
Titina Nardone .
Follow me .
Breathe !
He 's dead ...
Your aunt never changes !
She seemed so worried ...
Now what 'll happen ?
Will I die ?
I don 't think so , but I 'm no acid expert .
Are you seeing weird things ?
Like what ?
Other superheroes ?
Hulk , Captain America , Wonder Woman ?
No , just you .
Then you 're fine .
Gennaro , can you help my mum ?
She 's not well .
No , I don 't have those kinds of powers .
Sorry .
Do you have any super- friends who can help her ?
I 'll ask around but it 's not that easy .
Superheroes ... tend to look out for themselves .
Come on , you have to go now .
Bye , see you .
Auntie !
Wait , Peppino 's here .
I feel better , I want to go home .
I can tell , you look much better now .
You gave us a real scare ...
Vomiting is good for the body , it 's regenerative .
I read that somewhere .
Peppino , let 's go .
Come !
Can you imagine mum and dad 's face ?
I sure can ... then what 'll happen ?
They 'll realise that we 're special and say :
" What are you doing in Naples ?
Here 's a one- way ticket for London .
Go there and strike it rich . "
Right , as if it 's that easy !
We 'll blow them away , like we blow people away here .
They 'll say :
" Where are you from ?
You 're so special ! "
We need to come up with a story , the truth won 't do .
We have to act all mysterious ...
What story ?
Dunno yet , a story ...
You want all the answers tonight ?
You had too much acid .
You don 't believe it ?
If you don 't believe it , it won 't happen .
And we 'll get stuck here for the rest of our lives .
You have to believe in it .
All right , I believe it .
My husband 's cheating on me .
With the tobacconist 's daughter , her name 's Valeria .
She 's not even that pretty , if you ask me .
Is that a problem ?
What kind of question is that ?
A legitimate question .
No !
Of course it 's a problem .
I thought you 'd consider it a problem too , but you don 't seem to care .
Why didn 't you mention it before ?
Why didn 't you talk to your husband ?
Why the questions ?
Can 't you just say you feel bad for me ... that he 's a coward , a louse , and a bastard ?
If it 'll make you feel better , I 'll say it .
But that 's not our focus .
It 's not ?
Then what is our focus ?
You 're my focus .
I need to understand ... what you felt ... what happened when you found out he was cheating on you .
I felt ashamed ...
I felt ashamed for myself and for him .
I still feel ashamed every time I see him .
Does he expect me to make a scene ?
And splurt it all out ?
So my parents get involved and then I take him back ?
No , I won 't do that .
That 's not for me , I won 't do it that way .
He can do what he wants .
I 'll wash it and bring it back next week .
You should be thinking about yourself , not the laundry .
Right , " yourself ' ...
Don 't use that tone with me , I could require you to do things ,
I 'm your doctor , don 't forget that .
Who says I 'd do them ?
I think you will .
Actually , go do something for yourself today .
Carmela , call Dr. Matarrese and ask for a family discount .
We mustn 't be ashamed of our bodies .
Where 'd you hear this bullshit ?
Did it hurt ?
No , but her nails scratched me .
Peppino , want to know something I haven 't told anyone ?
The night before he died , Gennaro Superman came over .
He came into my room .
And then he did something strange ... he got completely undressed , he took off all his clothes and then asked me to do the same .
He said he wanted to see if we were the same .
I got scared and threw him out .
Dunno know what I thought he 'd do ...
Maybe he really wanted to see if he was the same as me ... the same as everyone .
What should I have done , not thrown him out ?
What do you think I should have done ?
Gennaro !
Superman !
Gennaro De Cicco !
Elio , listen ...
What ?
Do you love me ?
Would I have brought you here if I didn 't love you ?
Wait .
Why 'd you make me come all the way out here ?
I didn 't come here myself , aunt Titina took me .
I can 't keep running after you here , there , everywhere !
Crikey , I even have tar stuck under my feet !
Give me a hand .
You need turpentine .
Turpentine , my foot !
Give me that !
Gennaro ?
I have a question for you .
Ask what you will .
I have an answer for every query .
Is what Uncle Salvatore said true ?
That you went into his room and got undressed ?
Right , as if I have nothing better to do !
My last night on earth , I 'd get undressed in front of your uncle ?
That 's nonsense !
He 's so full of himself ...
He said before you got run over by the bus ...
Kid , you pay too much attention to what people say .
It 's just hot air .
I 'm the only one you can trust .
Do you trust me ?
So you didn 't go to his room ?
You 're a real pest !
Kid , I have better things to do , my life is very busy .
In fact , I 'd better go before I get too worked up .
My mission is complete .
Bye , take care .
Gennaro , wait ...
Come back , please .
Come on , please .
It 's late .
I 'll run and get Peppino .
Run ...
Is this the fair ?
You 'll love it once you 're on the rides .
You 're not coming , dad ?
No , it 's for kids .
It 's too high .
Nonsense , don 't be afraid .
I 'll watch you from here .
Don 't let him off till I get back .
Fly , Peppino , fly !
Hi , Valeria .
You 're 30 minutes late .
1 know , sorry ...
It 's hard for me to get away with Peppino .
Don 't say sorry , Sunday is the Lord 's day , a family day .
I 'm the nuisance .
Don 't do this .
I came , I 'm here with you .
With your wife sick I thought I 'd see more of you ...
.. not less .
But they need me .
Right , they need you !
Come on !
Don 't touch me .
You had me come here so we can argue ?
I don 't understand ...
I love you , but Peppino 's my son , Rosaria 's my wife .
Then stay with them and leave me alone , don 't bug me .
At lunchtime why do you always wait in the shop for me ?
Dunno , maybe because I 'm a jerk .
Dad !
Dad , come back !
Peppino , one more spin ?
No !
Dad , I can 't finish this .
I 've got an upset stomach .
Listen , Peppino ... why don 't you hug me ?
Like when you were small and all you needed was me .
Are you sure he 'll like it ?
It 's sugar , Peppino .
Everyone likes sugar , it 's sweet .
There he is !
Catch him , we 'll feed him .
He fell .
He didn 't fall ... he jumped .
It 'll clear up soon .
You think ?
Yes .
Like hell it 'll clear up !
Assunta , what 's wrong ?
Summer is over ... another year is passing by ... and I 'm still here , nobody will take me away .
You can only see Arturo , the boy from the bureau , by the sea ?
Where else ?
Should I have him come to my fancy abode ?
Enough ... the time has come .
I 'm the only one who works here .
I bust my ass and have to split it all with them .
If I 'm not careful , I 'll be left with nothing .
What 's that ?
Nothing .
Beat it , grandpa .
There 's a man at the door .
For you , his name 's Alfredo .
Alfredo ?
Perhaps Arturo ?
Arturo .
He said he 's gone door to door looking for you .
Shall I let him in ?
No !
Who 's that handsome man ?
You saw him , mum ?
Yes , I was at Antonietta 's .
Did he see you ?
Of course , he 's not blind !
Assunta , what 's on your face ?
We are not us !
Assunta , hear me out ...
I saw you by the sea , pretending to read the same magazine .
I saw you never bought a drink , even when your lips were dried out from thirst .
I saw you walk miles ... because you didn 't have money for the tram .
So do you really think ...
I 'd be afraid to see your house ?
No need to be ashamed .
I 'm waiting outside .
And I won 't move ... till you open up .
Yours , Arturo .
Hi .
Hi dad .
1 have a gift for you .
Is it alive ?
Try them on .
They 're shatterproof .
I spent a fortune on them , but you can 't break these even if you try .
How do I look ?
You 're beautiful .
Thanks dad !
Go look at yourself in the mirror .
In the bathroom mirror !
This one 's bigger .
That one 's nicer
What is it ?
I miss you .
So ?
You tell me ...
Antonio , go make some food for Peppino .
Come on , Rosaria .
Antonio , I 'm not well .
Don 't you understand ?
Maybe this will cure you .
Right , this is the cure !
Maybe it 'll work .
Wait .
Show me how it works .
You hurt me .
Good , that 's exactly what I meant to do .
The baby will hobble too !
Elio doesn 't hobble , he struts .
Yeah , right .
Is hobbling hereditary ?
Thanks .
No ?
1 expected as much from you ...
Sit down .
I 'll talk to mum .
If she doesn 't croak , Federico and I will take dad aside and tell him .
I suggest you stay far , far away on that day .
Then you and Elio will get married and go up north ... so you can give birth in peace without people nosing around .
Then , after a few years , you 'll come back to Naples ...
We 'll just tweak the baby 's birth date a bit .
What a mess !
Do you love the hobbler at least ?
Yes , but he 's not a hobbler .
I 'll go talk to mum .
I 'm sure it 'll be a girl , a beautiful girl .
And we 'll live happily ever after .
It 's pretty up there .
It 's a good place to live .
Elio will find a good job , we 'll have a house full of windows .
And we 'll have a great life .
When people hear about it they 'll say :
" How lucky I
That Titina of ours is so lucky ! "
When will you tell grandpa ?
Not the mirror , it 'll bring bad luck !
Worse luck than this ?
Peppino , just study .
That 's all we can do to save our family from disaster .
Do what I do , apply yourself even more than before .
Uncle , are you as smart as everyone says you are ?
That you 're brainy ?
So they say .
Will your exam be really hard ?
Extremely hard .
At times I don 't even understand the words I read .
I must think it over at night .
How long have you been studying that book ?
It 'll be 5 years in February .
But since it 's my first exam , I want to do it right , then I 'll speed up the process .
Study , Peppino .
No !
Why would we wait ?
We already have a house .
It 's a small apartment my mother bought .
It 's very bright .
Lovely , isn 't it ?
I finally found the right person to live there with me ,
I don 't want to waste any more time .
Stop , you 're embarrassing me .
Take off your coat !
No , it 's too pretty .
So , what do you think ?
He 's a good man , you can tell he loves you .
I 'm scared .
Why ?
I 'm not used to feeling this way .
All this happiness ... it makes me uneasy .
It 's on the fourth floor , there 's no elevator yet .
It has a terrace too .
Thanks .
You 're welcome .
Assunta , is one sugar okay ?
One is fine , thanks .
Look at her , so shamefaced .
The first time we walked arm in arm , her face turned crimson .
You can 't imagine how crimson !
That 's because she 's shy .
I know , but I thought she was feeling ill !
I almost took her to the ER , I thought she was having a stroke !
Hear that , Peppino ?
Knock it off , you 'll make it worse .
Why can 't I be happy too ?
Tell me why !
Are they new ?
Yes , they 're shatterproof .
They 'll never break .
No way !
Wanna see ?
I feel like I 'm a free spirit .
How come ?
Dunno .
Excuse me .
What 's going on ?
Peppino ...
Peppino , calm down ...
Calm down !
Let go of me !
It wasn 't my fault !
So who did the punching ?
Who kicked the teacher ?
My third mother is never around , just like you !
I can 't really see the island .
It 's beautiful .
The beach is spotless .
The soft sand gets stuck in your ears .
The water is so crystal clear , you can see fish from the shore .
The boats are brightly painted ,
lined up in a row .
There are some children playing in the sand ... two women chatting under an umbrella .
There 's a group of young kids standing together .
A girl 's bathing suit strap just broke ...
look at those fiends !
Instead of helping her , they 're pulling at it !
But the girl 's laughing , she 's having fun , Peppino .
She 's running , they 're chasing her to throw her in the water .
It 's cold .
They don 't care , they 're having fun .
Listen , there 's music now too .
It 's coming from Capriccio , where you can go dance during the day and the night .
What do you say , shall we go ?
You 're making this all up , I don 't hear any music .
Because you 're lacking imagination .
And you ... did you go dancing ?
Yes , I went one night .
You know , Peppino ... at the time they seemed like normal days to me ... but I was carefree then .
Maybe that was happiness .
When I slapped Peppino ...
I wanted to hurt him .
I got scared .
How odd ...
I 'm admitting something horrible .
And you 're not judging me .
What 's even odder ... is I don 't judge myself anymore .
How do you feel right now ?
I feel fine .
I guess crying helps me .
You 've cried other times .
Yes , but this is the first time I don 't feel ashamed .
Maybe it 's because I brought my own handkerchief .
Does everyone who comes here cry ?
Some .
Does it upset you ?
It depends .
When you do , yes .
I prefer to see you smile .
Sorry , that was a silly comment .
I was just trying to be supportive .
No worries .
Our time is up .
See you next week .
Goodbye .
What you said before ...
I apologise again .
It was very nice of you .
I 'm taking him home now .
Thanks , see you tomorrow .
How did things go today with Matarrese ?
Better , I think things are getting better .
Mum !
Don 't say a thing .
First your sister and the hobbler , and now ...
Take Peppino and go home to your husband now .
I swear to God , you children make no sense !
What happened ?
Nothing .
Nothing happened .
Hi dad .
Look what I got you .
" Perugina chocolates fill your home with happiness . "
When nightfalls ...
When nightfalls ...
Hi .
I 'm hungry .
Thanks .
Eat ...
Rosaria , I have something to tell you .
Antonio , it 's late .
Never mind .
Perhaps I 've been a bit absent .
I had lots on my mind and didn 't tell you .
We 're selling fewer sewing machines , times are tough .
Oh , problems at work ...
I see .
I asked to be transferred to the Naples shop .
It 's closer , I don 't have to drive ...
I can help you out with Peppino .
So you don 't have to go to Portici anymore ?
If they agree to transfer me .
You 're feeling better ?
A bit ...
Do you still have to see the doctor ?
Yes , until I get back on my feet .
I think it will take some more time .
Is Matarrese doing you any good ?
Yes , I like this place .
In that case , you should keep going .
Can I cuddle with you ?
Yes , I like this place .
Hi .
How are you ?
Look at me !
Have you been working out ?
I haven 't done anything , I 've finally found my true self .
1 like myself more .
Even your nose ?
My nose ... that 's more complicated .
Kid , listen up ... come with me .
Where ?
Peppino , you ask too many questions .
Come .
Would you grease up this door already !
Hands around my neck and hop on .
What for , Gennaro ?
I 'm scared .
Don 't waste my time , I have masses to do .
Hop on !
Close your eyes .
Are we on the Military School roof ?
Yes , I like this place .
Because there 's a great view .
No , I like knowing that boys in uniform are sleeping beneath me .
Makes me feel a certain something ...
I brought you here because I have something to tell you .
Something good or bad ?
Neither .
It 's just something .
Listen up ... you 're like me , not them .
Why ?
Dunno ...
But you 're more like me than you are like them .
So I have superpowers ?
No ...
Yes , but not like Superman .
I mean ... don 't lose heart if people don 't understand you .
It 's not that they don 't understand me , they tease me .
Ignore them .
They 're the ones with the issues , not you .
If , in the future , they mistreat you , give you a hard time , make fun of you ...
We came up here so you could tell me life will be the same when I 'm older ?
It 's up to you if your life will be easy or hard .
If you try to hide yourself , try to be someone you 're not ... you 'll be in trouble .
If you realise that being a loner , being a unique specimen is not a bad thing , then you 'll be happy .
Understand ?
Dunno , tonight you 're talking funny .
Kid , you 're a pain in the ass !
I can 't say anything more because you 're too young .
But remember my words ... eventually , they 'll spare you from ending up like me .
Do you trust me ?
I do .
Speech over ?
Yes , I like this place .
Now what ?
I 'd like to go home if you don 't mind , I 'm tired .
Hop on my back again .
Easy with those nails on my new cape .
Doesn 't your mum cut your nails ?
Are you ready ?
I 'm ready .
KRYPTONlTE !

I know what I want , but I can 't have it .
Not how you live .
I 'm trying to get over you .
You love someone doesn 't mean you stick around , screw up their life .
You 're walking out on family .
What do you know about dragons ?
Dr. Visyak .
Medieval studies , SFU .
Bobby Singer .
Tell him something for me next time .
Actually , just kick him in the jewels .
Raphael ...
Tomorrow you kneel , Castiel .
Are you proposing that I start a civil war in heaven ?
Ding , ding , ding .
Balthazar .
Of course I wanna help you .
The amount of power that it would take to mount a war ...
But what if I said I knew how to go nuclear ?
Purgatory .
You and Crowley are going after purgatory together ?
Just kill the Winchesters .
No .
Then I 'll do it myself .
If you touch a hair on their heads ... ... I will tear it all down , our arrangement .
Hello , Dean .
You 're like a brother to me .
So if I 'm asking you not to do something , you gotta trust me , man .
Or what ?
Or I 'll have to do what I have to do to stop you .
I 'm sorry , Dean .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Please , we didn 't know .
I 'm sorry .
Well , you know what ?
At least you tried .
Yeah , a fat lot of good it did .
Why did he even come , right ?
Well , Samuel 's journals are pointless .
I mean , I 'm sorry , but Jebediah Campbell has squat to tell me ... ... about how to stop Cass from cracking purgatory .
Well , actually , it 's not about the journals we have .
It 's about the one we don 't .
Meaning what ?
Well , that 's the bad news .
Our pal , Cass , didn 't stop in last night just to mend fences .
What did he do ?
Stole something .
What ?
The journal of one Moishe Campbell .
Moishe ?
Of the New York Campbells .
Wha ... ?
So we gotta get it back , right ?
Well , just read the copy I had already made .
Hi , glad to meet you .
Bobby Singer , paranoid bastard .
I think I zeroed in on something .
What do you got ?
" Went to talk to Howard Phillips about the events of March 10th . "
That 's March 10th , 1937 .
All right , so who 's this Phillips guy ?
Phillips ain 't his last name .
It 's Lovecraft .
Wait , H. P. Lovecraft ?
Let me see that .
Am I supposed to know who that is ?
Horror writer .
Yeah .
No , I was too busy having sex with women .
Anyhow , there 's one notion that comes up over and over again in his stories .
Namely , opening doors to other dimensions ...
... and letting scary crap through .
You don 't say .
So you 're saying you think Lovecraft knows something about purgatory ?
All I know is Moishe paid him a visit .
No .
No .
Just let her go , okay ?
No .
No .
Ben ?
There 's men in the house .
They killed Matt , they got Mom .
They 're coming .
What are they ?
Did you see their eyes ?
Teeth ?
No .
I don 't know .
Where are you now ?
Get to your mom 's closet .
I left a shotgun .
Dean , what do I do ?
Okay , Ben , listen to me .
Go to your window and jump .
What ?
Any bones you break won 't compare to what they 're gonna do .
Jump .
Okay , I 'm going .
I 'm coming right now .
I 'm gonna get you and your mom , I promise .
You with me , Ben ?
Ben .
Hello , Dean .
Fancy a chat ?
God , how long 's it been , Dean ?
Crowley , let them go , now .
Or I swear ...
Your chocolate 's been in my peanut butter for too long .
I 'm going to kill you .
I 've got your , uh ...
What are they ?
Ex- lady friend and not- kid ... ... that you 've backed the hell off .
I 'm telling you .
Last chance to let them go easy .
You 're adorable when you get all threatening .
Don 't worry .
I won 't hurt them .
Provided you and Jolly Green stand down .
Got it ?
Splendid .
Kisses .
What 's the story ?
He said Lisa and Ben keep breathing as long as we sit on our thumbs .
You think Cass knows about this ?
We gotta assume he does .
So , what are we gonna do ?
I 'll tell you what we 're not gonna do .
Sit here .
I 'm going after them .
I 'm going with .
No , Sam .
You and Bobby stay on the Lovecraft thing , okay ?
Cass is way ahead of us .
You 're nuts if you think I 'll let you alone .
Bobby takes the case .
No , guys ...
Bobby ...
This is a big ball , okay ?
We can 't drop it now .
Fine .
Then how are you two gonna find Lisa and Ben ?
I 'm sorry , boys .
Do I look like a manservant to you ?
No ?
No .
Then quit ringing for me , please .
This is important .
I was drinking a '75 Dom out of a soprano 's navel .
That was important .
Crowley 's alive .
Well , you 've been scooped .
Cass already told me .
Did Cass tell you that he is Crowley 's butt buddy , you smug little dick ?
Excuse me ?
Handshake deal .
Go halfsies on all the souls of purgatory .
He fill you in on that ?
Well , yes .
Yes , of course he did .
Yes .
Oh , yes , of course .
I ...
We can read it all over your face .
Look , Crowley and Cass took two people who are very important to me .
And I care about this because ... ?
Because maybe there is a shred of decency underneath this snarky crap .
They 're innocent people and I 'm asking for your help .
Hmm .
I see .
Fair enough .
Son of a bitch !
Dean , let 's just call Cass .
Maybe he doesn 't know anything ...
You 're not calling Cass .
Dean ...
We 're not calling Cass .
So , what then ?
You know , uh , horror , lowbrow , put us in the ghetto , fine ... ... but H. P. Lovecraft , this guy is literature .
I mean , he should be taught in schools .
He 's up there with Dickens and Dean R. Koontz .
Seriously .
Well , that 's definitely the angle I 'm taking with my piece .
Oh , okay .
Okay .
Sorry .
Please .
So I hear you have a large collection of Lovecraft 's private letters .
Yeah .
World 's largest .
Wow , you must be catnip to the ladies .
I 'm in a long- term online relationship , so ...
Well , I 'd like to ask you about , uh , Lovecraft 's last years ... ... specifically anything that might have gone down around March 10th , 1937 .
Okay .
Are you working on this with the other guy ?
Other guy ?
Yeah .
You know , trench coat , looks like Columbo , talks like Rain Man ?
Right .
We 're competitors .
Rival magazines .
Okay .
Okay , well , I 'll tell you what I told him .
Howard had a dinner party on March 10th .
Party ?
How many friends at this party ?
Well , six .
If by friends you mean co- worshippers in a black- magic cult .
They were getting together that night to perform a ritual .
Something big .
Define big .
Not much , just open a door into another dimension .
Why would they do that ?
To see what 's out there .
Maybe it 's friendly .
It 's never friendly .
I mean , I imagine .
So did it work ?
The spell ?
Well , uh , there was no mention of Cthulhu in the morning papers , so ...
Actually , I do happen to have several letters detailing the dinner .
Worst thing that was reported was a hangover .
So it 's ...
I 've got them right here .
Some ...
It 's actually pretty interesting .
Um , and they were ...
They were right the ...
They were right here .
Well , it 's not like an invisible guy could just pop in and steal them , right ?
Right .
Right .
Oh , uh , I 'll leave you to it and you call me if you find them , huh ?
Okay .
Hey ...
Thanks .
Thanks again for dropping by , huh ?
Lovecraft tried to jimmy a damn dimensional door .
Idiot .
So , what happened ?
And every guest invited to the hoedown , dead or disappeared inside a year .
Wow .
Um ...
So where are you off to now ?
Didn 't you say everyone there died ?
Seems the maid had a 9- year- old boy .
He was there .
So he 'd be , what , 83 years old now ?
Well , where is he ?
Same place he 's been ever since the big night : in a mental ward .
I see .
Um ...
Well , keep me posted , huh ?
How 's things going there ?
You got a lead on Lisa and Ben ?
Well , we 're making a few inquiries .
Slow going .
How 's Dean ?
About how you 'd expect .
Next customer .
Look , I don 't know anything .
Yeah , we 'll see .
Dean ?
Yeah ?
Look , man .
You 're running on , what ... ... whiskey and coffee and whatever else you 're taking .
And ?
And we 're grasping at straws here , man .
I kill enough of these demons ... ... eventually one of them 's gonna tell me where Crowley is .
So we good ?
You 've been at it for a while .
Let me take over .
You deserve a break .
No , thanks .
Dean ...
Sam , back off .
Lisa and Ben , wherever they are , that is a hundred percent on me .
And if they are hurt ...
I 'll yell if I need you .
Castiel , it 's Sam .
Um ...
I don 't know if you 're in on this whole Ben- Lisa thing .
But if you have any heart , whatsoever ... ... bring them back to us , man .
Come on .
Please .
I 'm begging you .
I am begging you .
Do you understand ?
Sweetie , you look tense .
You took Ben and Lisa ?
Oh , that .
I told you ...
Not to touch Sam and Dean .
I 've respected that .
I 'm merely exploiting the obvious loophole .
As long as I have the woman and the boy ... ... your fop- coiffed little heroes will be scouring the Earth for them .
Therefore not you and not me .
Everybody wins .
You should 've talked to me first .
I 'd rather ask forgiveness than permission .
Heh , heh .
Where are they , Crowley ?
You are not to harm them , do you understand me ?
You know what ?
You 're maxed out on putting humans out of bounds .
I 'll do with them as I please .
You wanna stop me ?
Go find frigging purgatory !
Call on the bat phone ?
Never call during business hours , do they ?
I 'll be back .
Cass , Cass , Cass .
So good of you to come .
Balthazar .
Why did you summon me here ?
Can I ask you a direct question ?
Of course .
Are you in flagrante with the king of Hades ?
Of course not .
Always were such a terrible liar .
So it 's true .
All right , then .
Why ?
It 's a means to an end .
Balthazar , you understand that .
Oh , absolutely .
But what 's the end here , exactly ?
Raid purgatory , snatch up all the souls ?
Win the war .
And I can only assume that you 'd be the vessel , correct ?
Suck up all those souls into yourself .
All that power .
It 's the only way .
Or too much juice for you .
In which case , you explode ... ... taking a substantial chunk of the planet along with you .
That won 't happen .
Sure .
Sure .
Of course .
Heh .
Just ...
Just tell me that it 's entirely risk- free .
I 'm sorry that I didn 't tell you , but I need to know .
Are you with me or not ?
You know , you may be certifiable , but fine .
In for a penny ... ... in for a pound .
How 'd you hear about this anyway ?
Oh , your howler monkeys , of course .
See , they 're just a touch worked up about that kidnapping business .
You 're sure you 're not with that other reporter ?
In the coat ?
Liar , that one , not who he says .
No , sir .
Uh , I 'm not affiliated with his paper .
I just have a couple of questions about a dinner party you were at in 1937 .
Everyone 's so fascinated .
Wanna know about my night at the home of the great H. P. Lovecraft ?
If you don 't mind .
Well , you know the story .
They did their spell and they all said it failed .
Do you believe in monsters ?
Yup .
You know , you go saying that , they 'll lock you in here rest of your life .
Whatever you saw ... ... you tell me and I 'll buy it straight .
The spell worked .
A door opened and something came through .
But it was invisible , so no one knew .
Except me .
How did you know , then ?
Because it took my mother .
It went into her .
She wasn 't the same .
She even smelled different .
And then she disappeared .
And surprise , surprise , one by one , they all start dying .
I 'm sorry ... ... about your mom .
You 're the first person ever said that .
Hey , you wanna see a picture ?
Mm- hm .
I 'll be damned .
I promise you , pal ... ... you start talking ... ... or I swear , I will rip your skin off .
Strip by strip .
And then I 'm gonna kill you .
And then I 'm gonna do it to the next demon .
Do you hear me ?
Yeah .
I hear you .
So you can stop talking , you miserable sack .
I didn 't ask for your help .
Well , regardless .
You 're welcome .
Why are you here ?
I had no idea Crowley would take Lisa and Ben .
Yeah , right .
You don 't believe me .
I don 't believe a word out of your mouth .
I thought you said that we were like family .
Well , I think that too .
Shouldn 't trust run both ways ?
Cass , I just can 't .
Dean , I do everything that you ask .
I always come when you call .
And I am your friend .
Still , despite your lack of faith in me and now your threats ... ... I just saved you , yet again .
Has anyone but your closest kin ever done more for you ?
All I ask is this one thing .
Trust your plan to pop purgatory ?
I 've earned that , Dean .
I came to tell you that I will find Lisa and Ben .
And I will bring them back .
Stand behind me ... ... the one time I ask .
You 're asking me to stand down ?
Dean ...
That 's the same damn ransom note that Crowley handed me .
You know that , right ?
Well , no , thanks .
I 'll find them myself .
Go back to Crowley and tell him that I said you can both kiss my ass .
Bobby ?
Ellie .
It 's been a while .
Come in .
So how did you find me ?
Well , we weren 't together long , Ellie , but I know a thing or two about you .
I know your safe houses .
And let me tell you , this one ain 't all that safe .
So did you come here just to , um , chat ?
I know what you are , Ellie .
You 're not exactly from Milwaukee , are you ?
Not exactly .
And not that I 'd have minded , but you kind of fibbed about your age too .
Just slightly .
Nine hundred years .
So , what 's your game , then ?
Game ?
Yeah .
Why are you here ?
Eve came through and raised all kinds of hell .
You 've been here how long ?
What 's with the slow burn ?
Well , you know , we 're not all alike .
Monsters ?
If you feel better calling me that , fine .
You 're from freaking purgatory .
You never thought to mention that the whole time you slept with me ?
I am what I am , Bobby .
And I happen to be a friend .
You wanna explain that to me ?
I didn 't ask those idiots to crack the door .
I was the thing that fell through .
Let me tell you something , you 're lucky it was me .
You 're saying you 're on our side ?
I 'm on my side .
I happen to like it here .
I don 't wanna see this place turned into some bloody wasteland .
So you killed H. P. Lovecraft .
Please .
That guy couldn 't even write " hello . "
I have spent 75 years trying to keep purgatory closed .
Why do you think I gave Dean the sword ?
To stop Eve .
Hell , you guys were supposed to kill the damn dragons .
Look , this all comes down to one angel .
He wants purgatory and he 's looking for you .
Well , thanks for the heads- up .
I know him , El .
He 's gonna figure it out one way or another .
Now , the only way I can stop him is to get ahead of him .
So I need to know how you open the door .
No .
No , Bobby .
It 's too dangerous for anyone to know .
If I found you , he ain 't far behind .
At least let me take you somewhere , protect you .
No .
Thanks .
I have a couple other places lined up .
Don 't worry .
Bobby ... ... you 're just a man .
I 'm better off protecting myself .
Drinking your feelings , Sam ?
I thought that was your brother 's bag .
Stressful times .
Well , we need to talk .
Why ?
Because ...
I know I 'm gonna live to regret this ... ... but I 'm officially on your team .
You bastards .
And we should believe you why ?
Would you believe I had a shred of decency ?
No .
Oh , that hurts .
Okay , you 're right .
It 's survival .
You see , I asked Cass some questions and I disliked his answers .
He seems sure of himself for a man who wants to swallow nuclear reactors .
I mean , these things can get a bit Chernobyl , you know ?
So voilÃ  .
Consider me your double agent .
Oh , and I took the liberty of searching for your friends .
Uh , took a while .
Crowley 's a clever one .
You found them ?
The upside is , yes .
The downside is , no , I can 't get them for you .
Why not ?
Because Crowley 's angel- proofed ... ... the whole bloody building .
I guess he doesn 't trust Cass .
That marriage is going swimmingly .
Okay , well , get us as close as you can .
Sure .
But then you 're on your own .
All right , boys , this is where I get off .
God be with you and what have you .
All right , be careful .
Oh , Dean .
Thank God .
Still gotta get you out of here .
Okay .
Okay .
All right .
Come on .
Come on .
Let 's go .
The brat 's not going anywhere .
And neither am I.
Crowley thought you might come .
So he had me jump this hot little piece of ass for insurance .
Can 't go losing our leverage , now , can we ?
Ah , another step ... ... free appendectomy .
You know , she 's awake in here , your mom .
I can hear her thinking .
Don 't listen to her , Ben .
What ?
I was just gonna tell him that you 're his real daddy .
Just kidding .
Who knows who your real dad is , kid .
Your mom 's a slut .
You shut your mouth .
Oh , what ?
You 're her white knight now ?
She wishes she never met you , Dean .
You 're the worst mistake she ever made .
Second worst , after keeping you .
That 's not your mom , Ben .
She 's lying .
Says the C- minus lay with 10 miles of daddy issues .
Whatever gets you through the night , Tiny Tim .
Ah , ah .
Back off , cowboy .
You know , she 's begging me to kill you .
She says you hold her back .
Never had a lick of fun since you were born .
Ben , look at me .
Look at me .
You 're gonna be just fine .
Ah !
Go .
Ben , knife .
What 's the matter , Dean ?
Hit me .
Oh , you don 't wanna hurt poor Lisa ?
Ha , ha .
Shut your mouth .
Stop it .
I 'm warning you .
You can go to hell , you black- eyed bitch .
You sure about that ?
Mom .
Ha- ha- ha .
Exorcise me now .
She 's just a dead meatsuit .
Now , what was it you wanted to say ?
Mom .
Lisa .
Lisa .
Here , put pressure on that , okay ?
I know , honey .
I know .
It 's okay .
It 's okay .
Sam , where are you , damn it ?
All right , Ben .
We gotta get her out of here , okay ?
Ben .
Ben ?
Ben .
Hey .
Listen .
Pull it together .
Be strong .
Your mom needs you .
Go over in that duffel bag .
Grab the salt gun .
I gotta carry your mom out , so if anything comes at us , you shoot it .
Go .
Now .
Okay .
Get the knife .
Get the knife .
All right , Ben .
Keep your elbow in , gun tight to your shoulder and watch for the kick .
Ben .
Ben .
Ben .
Dean .
Come on .
Pull it together .
You want your mom to die ?
Let 's go .
Come on .
Dean .
Sam ?
I 'm in here .
Come on .
We gotta get to a hospital .
Ben .
Give the gun to him .
Sam , we need a ride .
Yeah .
Go , go , go .
She 's fine , Ben .
She 's gonna be just fine .
We 're almost there .
Hey .
Hey .
Hey .
Stay with me .
Sam , you gotta go faster , man .
You 're gonna be fine .
You 're gonna be just fine .
Ben , I 'm sorry .
Ben .
What do you want ?
Dean , listen .
What do you want me to say ?
She 'll be dead by midnight .
I 'm sorry .
I don 't care .
It 's too little , too late .
Okay .
Well , regardless , I didn 't come for you .
Meaning ?
She 's fine now .
She 'll wake soon .
Dean , I said I 'm sorry and I meant it .
Thank you .
I wish this changed anything .
I know .
So do I.
All else aside , I just wanted to fix what I could .
There 's one more thing you could do for me .
Hey , Mom .
Hey .
What ... ?
You 're in the hospital .
What happened ?
We were in a car crash .
Are you okay ?
Yeah , yeah .
I 'm fine .
You hit your head pretty bad , but you 're okay now .
Hi .
Who are you ?
Uh , I 'm Dean .
Uh ...
The guy who hit you .
Oh .
I just , uh ...
I lost control for a minute .
And I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry .
But I 'm real happy you two are both okay .
And , uh ...
I 'm just ...
I 'm glad your life can get back to normal now .
We 're okay , so ...
So that 's what 's important , right ?
Yeah .
Anyway ... ... I 'll leave you two alone .
You take care of your mom .
Well ?
Well , nothing .
Dean , you have pulled some shady crap before ... ... but this has got to be the worst .
Whitewashing their memories ?
Take it from somebody who knows ...
If you ever mention Lisa or Ben to me again , I will break your nose .
Dean ...
I 'm not kidding .
Hey , what are you waiting for ?
Time to work .
What time is it now ?
Yes , thank you very much .
That 's alright .
Time to work .
Deliver these packages .
Go .
Don 't complain .
How about ...
Shut up .
Just go .
Quickly .
Quickly .
Work .
Work .
I know .
Thank you very much for using our service .
Too much talking .
So annoying .
Hey , have you finished signing it .
Who took off the saddle ?
Bastard .
Damn it .
What was pricked was not my asshole .
Jakkalaen .
Huh ?
Go to see Boss Seng .
He has a job for you .
Okay .
Good .
Quickly .
Don 't waste time writing .
Thank you darling .
I wanted tea .
Bitch .
What did you bring for me ?
You make me want to jump head first .
Left , harder .
Right , as hard as you can .
Yes , right .
Our gym is full of losers .
Lose today , lose tomorrow .
We lose every day , damn it .
You 'd better take a dump after each meal .
Harder .
Is this a boxing gym or a zoo ?
Harder , yeah .
Follow me .
When did you pass me by ?
Good .
You 're here .
Bring the stuff to Boss Guang .
Here 's the stuff .
And money ?
Hey .
Give her the money .
Here .
Money is delivered , stuff is delivered .
I sure hope so .
Hey .
Hello ?
What did you say ?
You 've got the stuff ?
Okay , good .
Boss , the stuff is delivered .
Nui .
Sir .
Bring me Roj .
I 'm here , Boss .
Bring me back the money .
How many men should I bring with me ?
She 's just one girl .
Only ten men .
Yes , Boss .
Oh !
Wang !
Hello there .
Hi there .
Another laundry service ?
Yes .
Have you got many clothes to wash today ?
Sort of
Do you need this soon ?
If so , I 'll try to get it done first .
It 's okay .
Just finish other customers ' first .
Noon , come help me hold this , please .
Hello , uncle Wang .
Hello , dear .
What 's that ?
Fabric Softener and Detergent , here .
I 've got them here .
You don 't have to bother buying these .
I want to make it easy for you , so I bought you .
Many thanks .
Do you want to join our meal ?
Oh It 's okay .
I 'm in a rush , got to go to open my shop .
Right .
I got to go .
Good luck .
I want to buy some sweets .
Where 's the vender ?
I 'm here .
Sorry for being short , okay ?
How much do you want to buy ?
Twenty baht .
Hand me the box .
Why don 't you pick it up ?
I have short arms .
Here ,
Pued , have you quit the drug ?
Damn it .
Don 't .
Don 't .
Don 't do it .
Get away from here .
Go .
3 copies for 100 baht , choose it here .
Choose it here , go ahead .
Every copy is HD .
I guarantee but no refund .
It 's in the theatre this morning , but in the afternoon I 'd get it here .
Wait right here .
Get out .
Why didn 't you open the door ?
Huh ?
Can 't you open it ?
The door is locked from outside .
What car is locked from outside ?
It is really locked from outside .
Go .
She 's gone .
Follow me .
That way .
Follow me this way .
Hey , give me the money .
What money ?
You choose the hard way , right ?
Huh ?
You want to be beaten up ?
Huh ?
Idiot , get up .
You worthless moron .
Go .
Can 't do anything .
Go .
You lost to a girl and a bike .
Go to hell .
Here it comes again .
Double jeopardy .
My hat .
Your hat .
Yes .
Your hat .
Oh , God .
Uncle Wang .
Hmm .
I 'd like to ask you for an advice about Jakkalaen .
Hmm .
Uncle Wang .
Hmm .
Do you think Jakkalaen will like me ?
Hmm .
Uncle Wang .
Hmm .
Are you freaking listening to me ?
I mean , are you listening to me ?
Why do you talk to me ?
Why don 't you talk to Jakkalaen ?
I don 't dare to .
Why ?
I 'm afraid to get hit .
Uncle Wang .
Hmm .
Have you had a girlfriend ?
Yes .
But she has passed away .
How did she die ?
Cigarette .
Cigarette .
Lung cancer ?
A cigarette truck hit her .
She didn 't use the pedestrian crossing .
I came to get an advice on love .
Didn 't expect to hear a sad story .
Don 't you know how to knock ?
What if I was changing my clothes ?
Yeah .
I 've seen you since your feet were smaller than a shell .
I want to tell you something .
Be careful about your work .
What work ?
What are you talking about ?
Well , you know what I 'm talking about .
It 's dangerous .
You might not get the chance to use the money you make .
What are you talking about ?
You 're talking nonsense .
Don 't pretend to not know about it , Jakkalaen .
I 'm warning you because I love you .
Do you understand ?
You are not my father .
Stop your grumbling .
It 's annoying .
Annoying .
Like singing to an elephant .
The door .
How did it go ?
All done , Boss .
Good .
Give me the money .
No , Boss .
I mean , we 're all done by her .
Then you don 't deserve to live here .
Where do you want me to live ?
In hell .
Oh , in your heart ?
What do you know ?
Heaven and hell are in your heart ,
Father Payom told me .
Take this .
Heaven 's in your heart .
Bullet 's in your brain .
Cremate him at Father Payom 's temple .
And ask Father Payom to preach for him .
Oh , wow .
Dead .
If I failed , I 'd surely be whacked like this .
Boss , I quit .
I will work for you forever and ever .
Almost got myself killed , idiot .
Hey , more water .
I looked at you this long and you don 't stop ?
Gee , are you crazy ?
Nothing to be worry about .
Okay .
I 'll be waiting .
I 'm at the office with my wife .
You can stop by .
Yeah , I 'm not going anywhere .
I 'm always here .
Yeah .
Okay .
Okay .
I 'm not in a hurry .
Okay .
Okay .
See you then .
Yeah , okay .
See you .
A good time to get a massage .
You 're always ready .
Feels so good .
So good .
This is called facial relaxation .
Even your feet smell good .
You can do anything , but don 't let my eyebrows fall .
That would be unforgivable .
Uncle Wang .
Hmm .
Do you think Jakkalaen will like me ?
Hmm .
Do you think you can help me ?
Let me ask you seriously , Duan .
Why are you so impressed with Jakkalaen ?
What made you like her ?
Don 't bully a weaker person .
Duan , get up .
Since then ,
Jakkalaen has always been in my heart .
Damn it , you dog phlegm .
I 'm not sure whether to call you pitiful or pathetic .
You must have grown up eating weeds .
Idiot .
What 's up , Reung .
Oh .
What do you want me to do ?
Thanks for coming .
You go get the job from Boss Piak Pakkred .
The paper has already decayed .
The details are in here ?
Hmm .
Okay .
Let 's go .
What kind of outfit is this ?
My office uniform .
What about your dinner outfit ?
More outrageous .
More than you can imagine .
Must not wear anything .
I 'm not that daring .
Piak Pakkred Service
Okay good .
You 've done a good job today .
We can work with each other next time .
Hey , give me two packs of the stuff .
Why don 't you shit on my face ?
Didn 't you see my face ?
And didn 't you see my ass ?
I see it every day .
But today is in close range .
What are you being upset about ?
Your period hasn 't come , huh ?
Yeah .
Okay .
This one is for Mr. Pheasant Plucker .
This one is for Mr. Fig Plucker .
The same person , actually .
Let 's repeat it .
Whose is this ?
Pheasant Plucker .
Whose is this ?
Fig Plucker .
Say it faster .
Phasant Plucker .
Fig Plucker .
Alright .
Enough .
Enough .
I don 't want you to pluck the wrong guy .
Okay , I 'll take the stuff .
I 'll deliver them to the Pluckers .
Good luck .
Let 's go .
Hey ,
I want to talk to you .
Not you talking to me .
I 'm not finished .
Don 't screw up .
Go .
When did you come here ?
Jeez ...
Why do I have so many pimples today ?
Too many of them .
Jakkalaen .
Damn it .
I can 't even hit my hand .
What am I going to do ?
Jakkalaen , you 've asked for trouble .
Soraya .
Sir .
Come here .
You bring your female assassins to take my stuff back from Jakkalaen .
You understand ?
Yes , sir .
Hello .
Hey , you dirty bitch .
You don 't think of doing anything today ?
Hey .
And are you done with this ?
I 'm done .
Stop moving it .
It gives me headache .
Just say it .
I think we might use only two bars on the solo part .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah .
We can 't go for four or eight .
Hmm .
What do you think ?
We can , but the little finger stays there .
Here ?
Yeah .
Oh , what about other fingers ?
Hey , is she your friend ?
Yeah , hey .
Just a minute .
Oh , what brought you here ?
I 've bought you cake .
From your favorite bakery shop .
I happened to go that way .
Oh , you didn 't have to buy it .
I just said the cake tasted good .
I don 't want to bother you .
Hey , you didn 't bother me at all .
I 'm happy to do it .
Thanks , then .
You 're welcome .
Okay then .
I 'll get back to practice .
Alright .
Can you leave your heart with me ?
Where were we ?
Okay .
Pong , whose cake is this ?
A friend of mine .
Come on .
Let 's practice .
Wang .
Yes , sir .
I 've heard some bad news about your niece .
You should take better care of her , okay ?
Yes , captain .
Superintendent .
Yes , superintendent .
That 's all I want to tell you .
Yes , sir .
Your movies .
Thanks .
I 'm leaving now .
Good , sir .
No reason to stay , sir .
See , I put all my heart into it .
I know she 'll like it .
Do you think she 'll like it or not ?
Like .
She 'll like me ?
The cake .
The cake looks better than you .
He 's kidding .
I 'm serious .
Is she coming today ?
If she knows you 're here , she won 't come .
Yes , I think you 'd better make it look better .
The cake ?
Your face .
He 's kidding again .
I 'm serious .
This is the second time .
Don 't think of it that way .
Look at my face .
And look at my beautiful wife .
See ?
I 'm saying that for an ugly person like you there 's hope .
Hopeful ?
Hopeless .
You 're kidding again .
I 'm not .
He really has an ugly face .
I feel guilty when you say things like this .
Your mom should be guilty too .
I think your mom has actually raised the placenta .
The real you is still inside the womb .
Don 't look at me like that .
I 'm just try to make you relax .
Don 't worry about getting a girl .
I have a secret formula .
Good .
A winning smile right there .
A lot better than uncle Wang .
Leave him alone .
He 's an old man .
Go .
Go .
You 're not a normal person , Rueng .
Look at how my wife looks .
Perfect from head to toes .
Go .
See you at the same place .
It 's hot today .
Which one ?
Today 's Sunday .
We close on Sundays .
We 're not here for delivery .
We want our stuff back .
What stuff ?
That 's the wrong answer .
No good .
Listen , Jakkalaen .
You 're cornered !
You 're going to return everything you stole from Boss Piak Pakkret .
Give me some time .
About a month .
I give you seven days .
Fifteen days .
Seven days .
Ten days .
I said seven days .
I 'm not selling vegetables , bitch .
Seven days is from Monday to Sunday , you know ?
Keep it in your head .
If you can 't do it , we 'll send you to hell .
Bitch .
We 're serious this time .
No fooling around .
Enough .
Being with you is like going to a carnival .
Let 's go .
Seven days .
Bitch .
Seven days .
My cake .
I won 't mind if you don 't like it .
Or if you don 't eat it .
But why do you have to do this ?
Duan .
Wait .
Duan .
Where is he rushing to ?
Oh , damn .
My office .
As messed up as mashed potato .
Too bad there 's no fried chicken .
Cole slaw would be nice too .
Jakkalaen .
What 's wrong , Duan ?
Nothing , Uncle Wang .
He made a cake for Jakkalaen .
Not only that she didn 't eat , she also trampled it , Uncle Wang .
It 's really pathetic .
Listen to me .
Jakkalaen is a sucker for sweet words .
You can try my poem .
I guarantee you .
You 'll surely get laid .
If not , I 'll let you step on my face .
Let me do it first .
Not so fast .
Listen to this .
Master Chalermchai rides on a Mustang .
Bank of Clash Band rides on a Thunderbird .
Sek Loso follows in a Porsche .
But me , I ride my heart for find you .
How about that ?
I have something to offer .
Love is delivered unquestionably .
You are the only one for me .
I Love You indefinitely , evermore .
It 's up to you .
You choose the one you like .
A forest of love ...
That 's enough , Naew .
Enough .
Yes , Uncle Wang .
Yes , that 's enough .
Yes .
Uncle Wang .
What ?
Why is Ood 's shop closed today ?
Ood 's shop ?
He got arrested yesterday .
Serves him right .
What a blabbermouth .
The Ministry of Commerce has issued a new law .
Anyone who sells pirated CDs or any pirated products will be fined up to 10 million baht , and five year in prison .
That 's good .
The filmmakers will be encouraged .
The music industry can get back on track .
Because the thieves will not dare to copy .
Yes .
Faking United .
You 're speaking like you 're frustrated .
I 'm not frustrated .
A guy like me works legally .
Sells only authorized products .
I pay my taxes .
I hate the thieves who steal other people 's ideas .
They don 't ...
What is it called ?
It 's a holy shit .
That 's right .
Translation ?
I don 't know .
Shit .
I better close my shop .
I 've got headache talking to you .
Are you okay ?
Hey , help me close the shop , you moron .
Hold the bottom , you cat bowel .
Yes , Uncle Wang .
Hey , don 't let my authorized VCDs fall .
I 'll pick them up .
Mok .
Let me tell you without turning left or right .
Straightforward .
Before you try to find a boyfriend ,
look at yourself in the mirror to see whether you deserve me .
Fried bananas that you give me every day ,
I 've never touched it .
Stop chasing me .
Mok .
I 'm going to back away from you .
Go .
Naew .
Duan .
Hey , what 's wrong , Mok Mok .
Only one Mok .
Uncle Wang , help me .
I 'm not Ann Landers , okay ?
I 'm not Hugh Hefner either
Though I wish I were him .
It 's Duan .
He told me to look at myself in the mirror .
Let me ask you .
What is not good about me ?
Oh , Mok .
I don 't know where to start .
I think it must be what you did in the past life .
Your bad karma has caught up to you .
Have you made any merit lately ?
Not lately .
Try to make some merit .
So that your life might improve .
Or you might go to the temple and offer some firewood .
Firewood , this much .
How much ?
Higher than you head .
Offer the firewood , and pray .
Pray , and light up the firewood .
When the firewood is on fire , you can jump into the fire .
Burn yourself .
Get reborn , so everything might be better .
Uncle Wang .
Are you okay , Jakkalaen ?
I 'm okay .
Who are they ?
Boss Piak Pakkred .
They want the stuff back in seven days .
How are we going to find it for them ?
It 's alright .
Let me talk to him .
Hey , Noon .
Hello , uncle Wang .
Hi .
Didn 't your mom pick you up ?
No .
Today we 've got an event at the school so we finished earlier .
Oh , right .
Come on then , I 'll give you a ride .
Get on .
Thank you .
Quick , let 's go .
So what 's the event ?
I don 't know .
And your mom is at home ?
Yes .
Shall we stop by for an ice cream ?
Thank you .
Here you are .
Uncle Wang .
If you like my mom , why don 't you tell her ?
You 've been keeping playing around , wasting time .
You are quite old , you know .
Eat it up so we can go home soon , your mom is worried .
Is it my mom worried or you 're worried about her ?
Too much now .
How much ?
150 , sir .
Damn pricey .
Now you 're home and don 't forget to do your homework
Thank you , uncle Wang .
See you later .
Uncle Wang , don 't forget what I told you .
What ?
Love won 't wait , the clock is ticking .
Bye !
Kids these days , they know too much .
Let me ask you .
Who gave you ?
My good looks ?
The permission to follow me .
Uncle Wang .
He wants me to help you .
It 's good that he 's with us .
So he can help us with little things .
Give him a chance .
Not before long ,
I 'm going to have to sell my house .
So I can go away .
Where are you going ?
To see your dad ?
Just one time .
Just one .
Can you not ask ?
It 's good that he knows everything about you .
Because in the future ...
Naew .
Check , please .
Wow , Naew .
You 're so good a person that you gave 5, 000 to a beggar ?
That 's my dad .
Your dad ?
Thanks , my son
Hey , Dad
I 'm looking for you for a long time .
You ...
Naew .
You ungrateful son .
This is your dad 's part time job .
Go .
If he were my dad ,
I would be so proud of him .
So proud my ass .
You make me feel sad .
This is just an installment , what about the other 3 ?
I don 't have it .
This is all I 've got .
If you don 't have any then why did you take the loan from us ?
I don 't have enough that 's why I took it .
I know .
If you don 't have enough to pay back then don 't take loan from us .
I 've been suffering with my boss for you too many times .
I did it for you , Fai .
Do you know that ?
Alright ,
I 'll take your drying machine and the fridge and we 're done here .
Okay ?
How could I do for a living ?
That 's your business .
How much do you need more ?
Oh Wang , 30, 000 to go , bro .
It 's okay .
I 'll pay it .
Come take it from me this evening .
Wow , Wang is the sponsor now .
Your look like this , then you need the money for a woman .
Ugly face like this .
This evening , right ?
30, 000 Baht at your place ?
Sepa , let 's go .
Why did you take the loan from them , you know their interest rate is high .
I needed the money .
Why didn 't you let me know ?
You 've helped us too many times , I don 't want to bother you .
Wang !
Wee !
You don 't have to be courteous .
If you needed it again , just let me know .
Noon , I bought you clothes and snacks .
Mom , was dad kind like uncle Wang ?
Yes , he was .
Their habits and everything are the same .
Then why don 't you let him be my dad ?
Oh Wang , you 're on time .
There you go , 30, 000 Baht .
Wow , you 're so cool man .
Ugly face like you can afford a woman ?
Thanks .
Let 's go , Sepa .
Where ?
Just follow me .
Let 's ignite the firecracker .
Wang !
Wee !
Wee !
Who did this to you ?
Wee !
Don 't leave me !
Wee !
Please wake up !
Wee !
Look at me !
What now ?
Are you stealing more ?
No , I want to pay you back .
Then why didn 't you let me know when you took it .
Just borrowing .
This is not borrowing , this is stealing .
Are you hitting on a girl ?
You 're having an affair , right ?
Did you know that she has got a child and a husband ?
Her husband might be out of town .
Be careful .
He might come to shoot you one day .
The Five Precepts , code 3 .
Do you know it ?
Kame ...
You 've been telling everyone but yourself .
You want the money ?
Take it .
Take it all and give it to her .
Don 't you have your place to stay ?
Sitting like a dog guard , do you want to get soaked with some hot water ?
What have I done ?
Go away !
Wang .
You 're doing your own sound effect ?
I 've saving the budget for you .
I 'll also do CG to erase your head too .
What business do you have with me ?
Do you dare to ask what business I have with you ?
I must want to buy a few of your authorized VCDs , son of a bitch .
Take care .
Wang .
I 'll make another set of exciting sound effect before you die .
Stay right there , or I 'll blow your gut .
Not only will your gut be blown , you will shit in your pants too .
Duan .
Take Uncle Wang .
Don 't .
You can live for another day , Wang .
But I 'll be back to make the sound of death for you .
Thank you very much .
Sit down , Uncle Wang .
A chair is for sitting down .
Who did you upset this time ?
So someone had to chase you with a gun .
None of your business .
It 's my problem .
You had to know my business .
But I 'm not allowed to know your business .
If I didn 't get there in time , he would 've put a few bullets in you .
You 're like this .
That 's why your wife killed herself .
Jakkalaen .
Jakkalaen .
Damn it .
Uncle Wang .
Make your mind a cucumber .
What are you talking about ?
Cool as a cucumber .
Did you ask me ?
Did you ask whether I wanted to play with you ?
Son of a bitch .
Wang .
Happy birthday , Wang .
Is today your birthday ?
Hmm .
I 'll be back .
You don 't know anything ?
Happy birthday .
Thank you so much .
Only you can remember my birthday .
I remember everything .
You are 53 this year .
You 're as old as the deceased Yodrak Salakjai .
Did I say anything wrong ?
Who designed this costume for you ?
Young L 'Oriche .
Where is he from ?
Don 't ask any further questions .
Coming up with this name is hard enough .
Have you worn it to the market ?
Do you dare to go with me ?
Jakkalaen .
Uncle Wang 's wife didn 't kill herself .
She died because of the cigarette .
Even though Uncle Wang is not your real father ,
He has raised you since you were a child .
He is just like a dad to you .
Today is his birthday too .
Happy Birthday to You
Happy Birthday to You
Happy Birthday Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday to You
Jakkalaen .
Is that really you ?
Right .
What did you do to your face ?
Why ?
Am I beautiful ?
Do you have to ask ?
Oh .
What kind of dress you 're wearing ?
It 's Duan .
I didn 't want to wear it .
But he insisted that I have to wear it .
I feel so cramped in this .
Is this my wife 's dress ?
Yes .
Reung .
I knew it .
I think I 've seen it before .
Hmm .
It does look good on you .
I wear it for you .
Let 's blow the candles .
Hold on .
Have you made your wish ?
I have .
Hold on .
What did you wish for ?
Well .
I wished for your understanding .
That 's all I want .
Hold on .
I 'm sorry .
I 've never been upset with you .
Even though I don 't have a child .
But I love you as one of my own .
Hold on .
That 's enough .
Let me blow the candles .
You 're 53 this year .
As old as a dead singer .
What power .
Blows out all the candles in one blow .
Okay , time to eat .
Come on .
Whose first piece is it ?
I give it to Jakkalaen .
Let his favorite niece have it .
Very nice .
Only half of it .
Take it .
Take this one .
Only half of it .
How many more ?
Two ?
Yes .
Okay .
Alright .
Enjoy your cake .
I 'm not going to eat it .
Shit .
This is minced pork .
I 'll eat it now .
Go ahead and enjoy it .
You don 't want it ?
It 's okay .
You can eat it .
It 's not a cake , it 's baby food .
I 'm not a baby .
You don 't want it ?
It 's good .
Holy Father .
Really .
Every year is like this ?
Really yummy .
Duan .
Naew , eat it .
Jakkalaen .
Jakkalaen .
What is it ?
Do you have something you want to tell someone , but you 're too shy to do it ?
Yeah .
But normally I wouldn 't keep it .
It would be frustrating .
Like if I 'm in love with someone , I 'd surely tell that person .
I think you should definitely tell that person .
Well , do you know how to cook ?
Yeah , I do .
Why ?
You 're hungry ?
I want to learn how to cook .
Can you teach me ?
You want me to teach you to cook ?
Hmm .
Hey , I can do it .
Let 's go to my house .
Come on .
I can teach you today .
Let 's go .
We can do it some other days .
Why not today ?
I 'm free today .
Let 's go to my house .
Come on .
Just push it down .
Like this .
Try it .
How to do it again ?
Over there .
Over there .
Not comfortable here .
Right here .
Alright .
Right here .
Hold the knife .
How 's that ?
No .
You 're holding the wrong way .
Wrong way .
This way .
Be careful .
Watch your finger .
No , you 'll get cut .
You 'll get cut this way .
Hold it .
Okay .
Chop .
No .
Too big .
Smaller .
Smaller .
Yes .
Is this right ?
Right .
Just push it down .
Push the knife down .
Don 't put your finger here .
Yeah , push it .
Oh , how 's your finger ?
Not yet .
Oh , I thought you cut yourself .
How hard do I have to cut ?
Huh ?
How hard ?
What ?
How hard ?
You call me sweetheart ?
Oh , how hard ?
Okay .
There , take the roots out first .
Uh , huh .
Like this .
Reung .
You and I have been doing business for a long time .
But your girl has sucked my stuff .
Hmm , I didn 't .
Don 't deny it .
You 've sucked my stuff .
You mean she has sucked in your stuff .
Suck in or just suck is no different .
But my stuff is gone .
Well , you know nowadays the police are smart .
Give me some more time .
Okay .
I 'll give you seven more days .
If you can 't return all of the stuff ,
I 'll cut your favorite body part .
Kill me instead .
See ?
You love yours .
How about mine ?
Mine ?
You have only seven more days .
The things you 've given me today is considered the interest .
Seven days only .
Alright .
Let 's go .
Hey .
Hey .
You bastards .
Do you see the damn way ?
Boss .
We 've never sucked your stuff .
Well , do you want to ?
That 's enough , bastard .
Always ask me to sing a song .
Ask me several times a day .
You think I have beautiful voice , don 't you ?
It 's true , but consider the time .
Just a few of ten thousands , I 'll give it back in 2 days .
It 's not about the money .
I 'm ordered to beat you to death .
Okay .
To return this much in only three days is considered a good job .
But it 's still not all of it .
You still have four days left .
Everything must be returned .
No problem .
A promise is a promise .
Good .
Then I 'll leave .
You can go .
Keep watching it .
Yeah .
Boss .
What ?
This guy fights well .
Good .
He will fight the main match next time .
Boss .
Jakkalaen has embezzled our stuff .
Not only that .
She also delivered it to Piak Pakkred .
What do we do , Boss ?
We can 't let her live .
Don 't mess up this job .
If there 's any progress , report it to me immediately .
Yes , sir .
I did it myself .
What is that ?
Pumpkin soup .
You want to try ?
On your mouth .
No .
Come on .
I 'll show you .
Like this .
Watch me .
D chord .
Hey .
Look .
Okay .
Look at the chord .
Okay .
Do you see ?
Come on .
Look at the chord .
Okay .
This is D. This is G. Hey .
Hey .
Jakkalaen .
You 're here in time .
I 'm getting hungry .
What do you have today ?
A lot of things that you like .
What is it ?
I think ...
Your friend Pong is a little weird .
Is there anyone who 's weirder than you ?
Why how is he weird ?
He seems to like other men .
Oh , wow .
Not only that you are bad- looking , but you also have bad mouth .
Let me ask you something .
When you were born , did your feet come out first , huh ?
Or did you come out horizontally ?
Did you eat the placenta when you were in the womb ?
That 's enough .
It 's none of your business .
Try to look after yourself first .
How annoying .
Just like what Apaporn Nakornswan sings .
I 'm upset .
I 'm upset .
I 'm upset .
Got the complete set .
I 'm beginning to wonder if I 'm really human .
She 's here , Boss .
What is it that you had to call me urgently ?
I have a big job for you .
Can you handle it ?
It depends ... whether the money is good enough .
Money is not the factor .
It 's always ready .
Just tell me whenever the stuff is ready , then .
Okay .
Bye .
That 's a big lot .
Are you sure you can do it ?
I am going to need help from the kids .
If you can 't make it , what are we going to do ?
Just believe me this time .
I guarantee you .
We 'll make it .
It 's up to you .
What a pathetic dresser I am .
Who else are you seeing ?
No one .
Jakkalaen .
Is this what you want to tell me ?
Is it ?
Yes .
Why didn 't you tell me you like elephant fight ?
Jakkalaen .
I 'm sorry .
It 's okay .
Enjoy your elephant fight .
Be gentle on your trunks .
Hey .
Hurry .
Go after them .
I got it .
I 'm going in .
Go .
Shit .
The cops have moved .
Lan Naew .
Lan Naew .
The pig has moved .
Go to Plan B.
The pig has moved .
Go to Plan B
Got it .
Go to Plan B.
Hey , guys .
Plan B. Go .
Go .
Go back .
Hurry up .
I think you 've followed the wrong guys , officer .
You found anything ?
Anything ?
I 'm here to ride for exercise , officer .
Did you find anything ?
Nothing , sir .
There you go .
You can 't find anything .
Officer ,
I can sue you back .
Yummy fried bananas .
Go .
Hurry in , hurry out .
Future of the country .
You 'd better take some shower .
I thought you 're wearing a necklace .
Okay .
Got it .
Tell me the place .
I 'll go pick it up .
Okay .
Got it .
Hey , get ready everyone .
My life is always around your stinky feet .
Let 's see how long you 'll be playing .
Shit , you bitch .
Now I 'm half man half stinky foot .
They can 't tell whether this is a face or a foot .
It 's an honor to take a picture with a foot .
Bitch .
You 've ruined my image .
Put it here .
Open it .
It 's good , boss .
Very good .
Can anyone
laugh for me ?
Hey , enough .
Why didn 't you laugh ?
He was fast .
Alright .
I 'd like to thank you all .
This time
I don 't have money but I have something else for you .
Reung .
I know .
Boss , over there .
What 's wrong with your ears ?
Boss Piak .
Seng is trying to take your stuff .
Seng , you dare to challenge me , huh ?
This stuff is mine , Piak .
Didn 't you say , we are two different rivers ?
Damn it , don 't ask me now .
Look at the situation .
Give me back my stuff .
I don 't have it .
You cheater .
You want to die together in a group ?
Let 's Spit .
Split .
Yeah , Spit and Split .
Go Spit and Split .
Go .
Piak .
Seng .
So ?
Let 's find a smart way to fight so we don 't have to shed our blood .
What 's your smart way ?
I 've killed two of the same side .
I 'm the best .
Why did you have to come quietly ?
Why are you smiling ?
You smile like you 're happy to see your wife .
The reason why I smile is because you look
like my wife who I rescued from a whorehouse .
Your wife is a whore ?
Shut up .
Don 't you dare saying bad things about her .
Even if she 's a whore , she works hard .
How much does she make each time ?
Depends on each guest 's generosity , bitch .
She 's not your buddy .
Do you want to die ?
Put down the gun .
I won 't .
Hey , that 's enough for this spot .
He 's done .
Wang .
Prepare to die , you bastards .
Shit .
Damn it , Wang .
You should never come back .
I told you .
I 'll be back to do the sound of death for you .
Today , both you and your niece will go to hell together .
Hey , drop the gun .
Or I 'll blow your brain out .
Well , what a shame .
I should have a flower for your corpse .
It 's alright .
Take this instead .
Encircle this warehouse .
Block the entrances and exits .
How are we going in then ?
Unblock the entrances .
Go .
Go .
Walk on .
You 're so smart , huh ?
Bastard .
So smart that we got arrested .
We 're going to the prison together .
Why are you sitting here ?
I don 't know .
I thought I want me to drive .
Go sit in the back .
Go .
There are 6 suspects being sent .
Hey bald man , why would you struggle ?
Go .
Wang .
Yes , sir .
Thank you very much for your cooperation .
All of you here ,
I 'll make you witnesses .
Jakkalaen .
Quit it , okay ?
I 'll arrest you next time .
What are looking at me for ?
What is it , Duan ?
Do you want to sing ?
Uncle Wang .
This is really my father ?
Sure .
How did he die ?
Wang .
Wong .
Get away .
What 's my dad like ?
From what I could see , he 's stupid .
Really .
How about mom ?
Three days after she gave birth to you , she remarried .
Her womb hadn 't had a rest .
Must have hurt a lot .
There are three people who love and care about you .
One person has died .
Another one is me .
Who 's the other one ?
Go .
Heartbroken even thinking about it .
Bye , dad .
Uncle Wang , may I call you dad ?
Actually they 're quite right for each other .
They are .
What about us ?
Keep trying a little bit more .
Now that 's something to keep me go on .
Hey , what is this ?
The shooting is done ?
Hey , is that it ?
Hey , the shooting is done ?
It 's finished ?
Yes , it 's done .
Oh , you 're telling me the shooting is done ?
What is wrong with you , Mum ?
Are you still my friend ?
The film is done , but the audiences have no clue I 'm in it .
The audiences don 't know I play in this film .
What is it with this face covering ?
See .
Hello , I 'm Nong .
Anyone can see me ?
You see !
They hurry back already .
The film is done , but nobody knows that I 'm here .
Hi , I 'm Nong Cha Cha Cha .
See ?
Why do you bring me here for , Mum ?
Cover the face like this !
Action
Can you knock ?
Do you forget changing my clothes ??
Oh !
I 'm very sorry .
What 's about mom ?
Three days after she gave birth to you , she remarried .
Her womb hadn 't had a rest .
Must have hurt a lot .
Did you know that she has got a child and wife ?
Her husband might be out of town .
A child and a husband
30, 000 to go , bro
Are you Okay ?
Okay ?
What ?
I 'm sorry .
30, 000 to go , bro
It 's okay .
I 'll pay it .
Come take it from me this evening .
No !
I 'm not okay like you .
How did she die ?
Cigarette .
Lung cancer ?
A cigarette truck
A truck ?
Shi !
Is that them ?
Jesus Christ .
Are they going to do it right here ?
You guys ever been through this before ?
No .
It 's best to ignore it , keep your head down , and go back to work .
Go on .
Don 't watch .
Timothy Singh ?
Yes .
I 'm afraid we have to speak with you .
Come .
Eric Dale ?
Excuse me ?
Eric Dale ?
No .
Sorry ?
I 'm not Eric Dale .
I 'm so sorry .
He 's my boss .
He 's down the hall .
Thanks .
Excuse me , Mr. Dale ?
This way .
Okay .
I am obviously sorry that we are here today .
But these are extraordinary times , as you very well must know .
Look , I run Risk Management .
I don 't really see how that 's a natural place to start cutting jobs .
We hope you understand this is in no way personal .
The majority of this floor is being let go today .
Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering .
Okay .
Mr. Dale , the firm is offering you a six- month severance at half your salary .
You will keep all unvested options that you currently hold .
Health will be extended through that period .
You have until tomorrow at 4 : 47 to either take the offer or it will be revoked .
Do you understand ?
Yes .
Unfortunately , Mr. Dale , due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here , the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature .
I hope , considering your over 19 years of service to the firm , you will understand that these measures are in no way a reflection of the firm 's feelings towards your performance or your character .
I don 't understand .
She 's apologizing for what 's about to happen .
Your company e- mail , access to the server , access to the building , and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting .
And this gentleman will take you to your office so you can clear out your personal belongings .
What about what I 'm currently working on ?
I 'm in the middle of something that ...
The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward .
But we do appreciate your concern .
We understand that this is difficult .
And here is my card .
Please contact me in the next few weeks if you need any assistance with this transition in your life .
Sir .
Okay .
Okay .
Okay .
Hey .
I 'm sorry .
You still alive ?
For now .
Congratulations .
It was a bloodbath .
I heard .
Listen , Eric , if there was something I could have done , I would have done it .
I know .
All right ?
Yeah , I know .
I know .
Okay .
Just tell me , who was it ?
Come on , Eric .
Come on , Will .
Rogers ?
I 'm not going to say , you know .
You know me .
Robertson ?
That cunt .
I knew it .
I knew I shouldn 't have fucking gone to her last year .
It wasn 't anyone .
Eric , you know what it was ?
It was bad luck , and that 's all it was .
Yup .
Yup .
All right , well , good luck .
Will ?
Come here .
I was just in the middle of a lot of shit right here that I think somebody needs to take a look at .
Eric , listen , they 're telling us everybody needs to get out of here .
Just leave their stuff .
And while we appreciate your concern , this is not your problem anymore .
Good luck .
Thank you .
Right this way , Mr. Murphy .
Eric , I 'm very sorry .
Yeah .
Did they say what was going to happen with us ?
Jesus , Seth .
What ?
It 's going to get pretty ugly around here for a while .
But , you know , you guys will be all right .
Good luck , Eric .
All right .
I 'll see you around , okay ?
All right .
Thank you .
Eric .
I wanted to say thanks .
It 's not necessary .
Well , it is .
You were the person around here that I ...
I know .
Hey , look ,
I was working on something , but they wouldn 't let me finish it .
So , take a look at it .
Be careful .
We 're sorry .
The telephone you are calling from is not in service at this time .
Robertson !
Sarah Robertson .
Sarah .
You shut off my phone ?
Eric , I didn 't do anything .
Fuck you .
Well , that was fucking hideous .
It 's gonna get worse before it gets better .
You think ?
Much .
You got any Nicorettes ?
I 'm out of Nicorettes .
Which means in about 10 minutes I 'm going to kill someone .
You all right , Sam ?
My dog is dying .
I 'm sorry .
Just got off the phone with the vet .
Fucking tumor on her liver .
I was spending , like , $1, 000 a day already just trying to keep her alive .
Yeah ,
I don 't have a fucking clue what to do about it .
Well , they 're all gone .
So ...
How many do we have left ?
About 33 .
Well , make sure they 're all out there .
I 've gotta say something .
Yeah , no , they 're ready .
They 're ready for you .
All right , let 's hear it .
You 're all still here for a reason .
80 % of this floor was just sent home , forever .
We spent the last hour saying our goodbyes .
They were good people and they were good at their jobs , but you were better .
Now they 're gone , they 're not to be thought of again .
This is your opportunity .
On every floor of this building and in every office , from Hong Kong to London , the same thing is happening .
By the time we 're done , three of every seven guys who were standing between you and your boss ' job are gone .
That is your opportunity .
I 've been with this place for 34 years , and I can tell you this is not the last time that you 're gonna go through this .
But you are all survivors .
And that is how this firm , over 107 years , has continued to grow stronger .
So keep your heads high .
Get back to work .
Let 's hear it .
Everyone 's going out , man .
You should ...
Come on .
No , man .
I 'm cool .
Thanks .
Okay .
Well , if you change your mind , just give me a call .
I will .
Come .
Where you guys going ?
The Grand .
I will call you when I am done .
All right .
Hey , be glad you 're still alive .
I am .
Have a good night , man .
You , too .
Come on .
Come on .
Come on .
We 're sorry .
You 've reached a number ...
Fuck me .
Fuck ! ... that has been disconnected .
Hello ?
Hey .
I can 't hear you .
What ?
Can you go outside ?
It 's too loud .
Hold on a second .
It 's loud .
Just give me a second .
All right , what 's up ?
Hey , where are you ?
Lugo .
Okay .
Are you with Will ?
Yeah .
Will Emerson ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
I think he 's still here .
Why ?
All right .
I need you to get Will , and I need you guys to come back up here .
Where ?
To the office .
What ?
I 'm serious .
Wait a sec ...
You want me to get our boss ' boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10 : 00 on a Thursday night ?
Well , our boss got axed , so technically he is our boss ,
and yes , that is what I want you to do .
Why ?
Look , man .
Just trust me , okay ?
I need you guys back here now .
All right .
We 'll be there in 10 .
Fuck .
Have I ever told you how much I love your bag ?
No , really .
Do you have a little dress that matches it ?
Yeah , I do .
Because you could bounce around in it like a fucking girl .
Hey !
Look who 's burning the candle at both ends .
Why didn 't you come out with us ?
There 's no more cuts planned .
You don 't have to kiss my arse .
I frankly don 't even know what it is you guys do .
Well , I 'm really sorry I had to bring you guys back here ,
but ...
That 's all right .
What 's going on ?
Look at this .
Eric gave me this file before he left .
Eric ...
Dale .
And he told me that he couldn 't quite figure it out .
And the last thing he said to me before the elevator doors closed was , " Be careful . "
He said , " Be careful " ?
Yeah .
So , obviously , I 'm a little curious .
I start to get into it a little bit , and I realize that the only thing that he 's missing ...
This is not good , Will .
All right .
Okay .
So what is he doing here ?
No , no .
Go to model four .
It makes more sense .
Okay .
All right .
What is this ?
This is basically everything that we have in our books at any given time .
But , what Eric was trying to do was to work these numbers for levels of volatility that fall outside of the standard VAR model .
What are those levels ?
It 's fairly complicated .
Simplify .
The volatility levels are set using historic patterns , basically , and then stretching those patterns out another 10 , 15 % roughly .
All right , so ?
So , we are starting to test those historic patterns .
When ?
Today .
Tuesday .
Monday .
Last Friday and Wednesday .
Two Fridays ago .
All right .
I get it .
Fuck me .
Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction , this is fucking huge .
How huge ?
Well , the losses are greater than the current value of the company .
Projected losses .
The projected losses , Will .
And this is just our floor ?
Yes .
Where the fuck is Eric Dale ?
I don 't know .
I tried to call him .
His phone is off .
What do you mean ?
They turned everybody 's phone off that they axed today .
Fucking ruthless .
Did you try his personal cell ?
Yeah , I called his cell phone .
It 's not on .
Call his home .
At this hour ?
Yeah .
Do we even know if he 's right ?
Looks pretty fucking right to me .
It does .
Mrs. Dale , it 's Will Emerson .
I 'm fine , thank you .
May I speak with Eric ?
No , we 've tried that .
His phone appears to be off .
Listen , could you have him call me the moment he comes in ?
The moment he walks through the door .
Thank you so much .
Goodbye .
Where the fuck is he ?
Doesn 't he have , like , three kids ?
So ?
Fuck , I don 't know , would you go home ?
I know where he is .
I need you two to go and get him .
There will be a car waiting for you downstairs .
You need to go .
Right now ?
Yeah , right now .
What are you going to do ?
I 'm going to call Sam .
Fuck me .
Yes ?
It 's Will .
It 's 11 : 00 at night .
I know .
I 'm sorry .
I wouldn 't have called .
What 's the problem ?
I think you need to get back here .
What ?
Sam , listen ...
It 's 11 : 00 at night .
I 'm well aware of the fucking time , Sam .
I 'm telling you , you need to see this .
See what ?
It 's ...
E- mail it to me .
I don 't think that , that would be a good idea .
I 'm on my way .
Look at these people .
Wandering around with absolutely no idea what 's about to happen .
Right ?
Well , I try to not let work get to me like that .
I 've noticed that about you .
Come on .
We 're 23 years old .
I 'm 28 .
All right , 28 .
Whatever , it 's the same thing , but I made nearly a quarter of a million dollars last year .
Fuck .
For what ?
I push numbers around on a computer screen .
A bunch of glorified crack addicts are willing to take that information , and they pretend to understand it , and they bet it against some other jock halfway around the world who , you know , if he wasn 't doing this , he 'd be in an OTB somewhere , putting it all on number seven , you know ?
At the end of the day , one guy wins , one guy loses .
You do know it 's a little more complicated than that , right ?
Yeah .
It 's Will .
He wants to know if we found him .
What do I say ?
Let 's say that we haven 't found him yet .
Okay .
Hey .
Hey .
So ?
Eric Dale .
Oh , Jesus .
Before he leaves the building , escorted by fucking security , by the way ...
I had nothing to do with that .
I know .
I 'm sorry .
Go on .
Before he leaves the building , he hands this disk to Peter Sullivan .
Who 's Peter Sullivan again ?
Doesn 't matter .
He 's one of Eric 's guys .
All right .
But before the elevator doors are closing , the last thing that he says is , " Be careful . "
" Be careful " ?
Yeah .
" Be careful " ?
Yeah .
Why ?
Take a look .
Oh , Jesus .
You know I can 't fucking read these things .
Just speak to me in English .
All right .
Basically , this kid , Peter Sullivan , he gets all inspired by your pep talk .
Nice job , by the way .
And he delves straight in after work .
And I think he nailed it .
Nailed it ?
Yeah , I think he figured out what Eric was missing .
And ?
It 's not good , Sam .
These here are the historical volatility index limits which , of course , our entire trading model relies on pretty fucking heavily .
Well , we 're now so levered up that once it gets outside of these limits , it gets ugly in a hurry .
And how close to those limits have we gotten ?
Sam , we 're beyond close .
We broke through these limits five or six days in the last two weeks .
Now , somehow we 've managed to stay on the right side of it for now .
For now .
Well , look what happens when we get on the wrong side of it .
Wait a minute .
What am I looking at ?
You 're looking at this figure here .
Whoa .
Is that ...
Yeah .
And that would not be a bad day for us , historically speaking .
Is that figure right ?
I don 't know .
I can 't be sure .
Where 's Eric Dale ?
We shut his phone off .
Of course we did .
Yeah .
So I called his wife , who says he 's not home .
Yeah , he 's probably crying in some fucking beer somewhere .
Yeah , or worse .
Where 's the kid that did this ?
I sent him out looking for Eric .
You think he knows what he 's doing ?
I don 't know .
What do I know ?
Get him back here .
Get him back here .
What do you think these girls make in a night ? $1, 500 ?
Two grand ?
Two grand .
Fuck .
That 's ...
That 's pretty great .
I mean , all considered .
Shit .
Will .
Yep .
No .
No , we asked , and nobody 's seen him .
Okay , yep .
All right , so what do you think Rogers makes in a year ?
I don 't know , I have no idea .
Come on .
Play along .
What year ?
I don 't know .
Last year .
Three quarters of a million .
Come on .
What ?
Oh , it 's not even close .
More ?
Much more .
A million ?
Will Emerson made two and a half million last year .
Fuck you .
Fuck me .
Fuck you .
How do you know that ?
He told me .
He just told you ?
I asked him , and yeah , he told me .
You think that 's true ?
Yeah , probably .
That 's fucked up .
Why is that fucked up ?
I don 't know , does it seem right to you ?
Right ?
I mean , right is ...
Right is ...
Jesus .
So what do you think that means Rogers puts away ?
I have no idea , Seth .
This traffic is a fucking nightmare .
Sorry .
Gentlemen .
Will .
Mr. Rogers .
Come with us , please .
Sam , this is Seth Bregman and Peter Sullivan .
Sir .
Will ?
Where are we going ?
We 're going to get a second opinion on your work , Peter .
So , Sam , what do you have for us ?
It 'll be here in a minute .
Finding somebody in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge .
Okay , let 's go right into the introductions .
This is Sarah Robertson , who you know .
Chief Risk Management Officer Ramesh Shah from upstairs .
And David Horn , one of the firm 's in- house counsel .
Nice to meet you all .
This is my Head of Trading , Will Emerson , and this is ...
Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman .
They work in our Risk Department .
Where 's Eric Dale ?
He was let go today .
Who do you have left in your Risk Department ?
As of today that would be Peter and our Junior Analyst , Seth .
Really ?
Will Emerson ?
Yes , please .
Just hand them out .
Thank you .
Apparently , Eric had been working on this for some time , but he wasn 't able to finish it .
This morning , as he left the building , he handed the program to Peter here and asked him to take a look at it .
Peter did .
He put a few things in that Eric seemed to be missing , and this is what came out .
Peter , is this your work ?
Mostly Mr. Dale 's .
But is this your draft ?
Yes .
Again , expanded on the original work by Mr. Dale .
But , yes .
What 's your background ?
My background ?
Your CV ?
I 've been with the firm for two and a half years , working with Eric that whole time .
But I hold a doctorate in engineering , specialty in propulsion , from MlT with a bachelor 's from Penn .
What is a specialty in propulsion , exactly ?
My thesis was a study in the ways that friction ratios affect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads .
So , you 're a rocket scientist ?
I was .
Yeah .
Interesting .
How did you end up here ?
It 's all just numbers , really .
Just changing what you 're adding up .
And to speak freely , the money here is considerably more attractive .
What time is it ?
2 : 15 .
Fuck me .
Fuck me .
And I 'm guessing by the fact that you two haven 't said anything that the math checks out .
Look , we 'd need some time to go over this .
But Mr. Sullivan here seems like he knows what he 's doing .
So , it would appear we have a problem .
Thank you for that .
What time is it ?
2 : 16 .
Fuck me .
Fuck me .
Sam , how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books ?
What ?
All of it ?
Yes .
I don 't know .
Weeks .
Weeks ?
Yeah .
Weeks .
But you certainly know that our business is selling and buying ?
It doesn 't work for very long without both components .
We suddenly stop buying for a day or two , that 's not something you can hide under the rug .
That gets out .
And when it does , this whole thing comes to an end , and right quick .
I understand .
Do you ?
Yes .
How many traders do we have left between your floor and Peterson 's ?
I don 't know , what ...
60 .
Jared , as I look at this more closely , it is these VAR numbers that are setting this thing off .
Excuse me .
I warned you about this last year .
We would not be in this position if we had done what I ...
Please .
As I was saying , and I speak completely off the record , it 's only a matter of time before someone else starts putting these in and they come up with exactly the same results and look at exactly what we 're looking at right now , if they haven 't already .
Understood .
And , Sarah , what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might remain on the books , if they had to ?
Why would they still be on the books ?
Because suddenly nobody wants to fucking buy them .
Fuck you , Sam .
Will you give me
a fucking break here ?
Excuse me , Jared ...
Without an active market , it would take weeks or months for me to come up with an accurate value on them .
You would have to go block by block .
Look , Jared , it 's a very simple business , right ?
We talked about this .
Sam .
Will , Peter , and ...
What the fuck is his name ?
Seth .
Thank you .
Seth .
Could you please give us a few moments ?
And , Peter ?
Has anyone else seen this ?
No , no one aside from us .
And Eric Dale .
Yes .
And can it really be possible that we don 't know where Eric Dale is ?
I called his wife , he hasn 't come home yet , and we turned off his phone today .
Perfect .
Well , I 'd like to know where he is .
Jesus fucking Christ .
Who is that guy ?
Sam 's boss .
He looks like he 's 15 years old .
He 's 40 .
Yeah , how does that happen ?
Oh , it happens all the time .
Except to me .
Kid 's a fucking killer .
What are they talking about in there ?
It ain 't pretty .
What ain 't pretty ?
If people stop buying what we 're selling .
Jared .
You cannot be doing what you 're thinking of doing .
Well , I don 't see any other choice .
What does that mean , we don 't have a choice ?
Fuck you , you don 't have a choice .
Fuck me ?
Did you even look at the numbers , Sam ?
Yeah , but what do I know ?
Correct me if I 'm wrong , Mr. Shah , but these numbers , they don 't add up .
One and one no longer makes two .
Look , if I may , I would like a little bit more time .
Jared , we can 't tell you yet .
Are you fucking kidding me ?
We have talked about this .
We need a little more time to give you our conclusion .
Okay .
We meet again in 45 minutes .
Sam , do you have the file ?
Yeah .
What are you going to do ?
Are you gonna call him ?
I already have .
Jesus .
Wow , that 's gorgeous .
It 's a long way down .
Yes , it is .
Will , don 't do that .
Come on .
You know the feeling that people experience when they stand on the edge like this isn 't a fear of falling .
It 's the fear that they might jump .
That 's very deep and depressing .
Thank you .
Yeah , well , I 'm a little dark sometimes .
All right .
Come down , please , Will .
Please , come on .
Will .
Yeah , fuck it .
Not today !
It looks like they 're going to make us dump this shit .
What ?
You watch .
How ?
You 'll see .
How could they do that ?
They can 't .
It 's impossible .
But they 'll figure a way .
I 've been at this company for 10 years , and I 've seen things you wouldn 't believe .
When all is said and done , they do not lose money .
They don 't mind if everybody else does , but they don 't lose .
Will ?
Did you really make two and a half million last year ?
Yeah , sure .
How did you spend it all ?
It goes quite quickly .
You know , you learn to spend what 's in your pocket .
Two and a half million goes quickly ?
All right , let 's see .
So the taxman takes half up front , so you 're left with one and a quarter .
My mortgage takes another 300 grand .
I send 150 home for my parents , you know , keep them going .
So what 's that ?
800 .
All right , 800 .
Spent 150 on a car .
About 75 on restaurants .
Probably 50 on clothes .
I put 400 away for a rainy day .
That 's smart .
Yeah , as it turns out , ' cause it looks like the storm 's coming .
You still got 125 .
Yeah , well , I did spend $76, 520 on hookers , booze , and dancers .
But mainly hookers .
76, 500 ?
I was a little shocked initially , but then I realized that I could claim most of it back as entertainment .
It 's true .
Holy shit !
Goddamn !
The cavalry is here !
Come on , we should go .
How old are you ?
43 .
Jesus .
This is bizarre .
It 's like a dream .
I don 't know , seems like we actually may have just woken up .
Come in .
How do we look ?
I should go .
No .
You should stay .
So ?
It 's legit .
The kid killed it .
The formula 's worthless .
What does that mean ?
It 's broken .
There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation .
Well , we were wrong .
No , you mean you were wrong .
Now , don 't get me started .
We discussed this .
I 'm heading for the conference room .
No , I want you to hear this .
I don 't want to hear this .
How do you think I 've stuck around this place so long ?
I called Tuld .
Do we have a contingency plan here ?
A contingency plan ?
Yes .
No , we went all in on this one .
So we 've gotten ourselves quite exposed here , haven 't we ?
To Tuld or the market ?
To both .
He 's here ?
Tuld 's helicopter just landed .
I know .
Come with us .
Where 's Sam ?
I don 't know .
You sure you want all of us ?
Yes .
One piece of advice for everyone before we go in there .
This could get a little ugly .
But whatever you do , just tell the truth .
No sugarcoating .
Do not change a word of it .
No one here is smart enough , including the rocket scientist .
Mr. Cohen .
Morning .
This way , please .
He 's already in there waiting for you .
Excellent .
John .
Please , sit down .
Welcome , everyone .
I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour .
But from what I 've been told , this matter needs to be dealt with urgently .
So urgently , in fact , it probably should have been addressed weeks ago .
But that is spilt milk under the bridge .
So , why doesn 't somebody tell me what they think is going on here ?
Mr. Tuld , as I mentioned earlier , if you compare the figure at the top of page 13 ...
Jared , it 's a little early for all that .
Just speak to me in plain English .
Okay .
In fact , I 'd like to speak to the guy who put this together .
Mr. Sullivan , is it ?
Does he speak English ?
Sir ?
I 'd like to speak with the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess .
Certainly .
That would be Peter Sullivan .
Right here .
Oh , Mr. Sullivan , you 're here .
Good morning .
Maybe you could tell me what you think is going on here .
And please , speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever .
It wasn 't brains that got me here .
I can assure you of that .
Well , sir , as you may or may not know , I work here for Mr. Rogers as an associate in the Risk Assessment and Management Office at MBS .
Please .
Just relax .
Stand up .
Tell us in a clear voice .
What is the nature of the problem ?
Okay .
As you probably know , over the last 36 to 40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different tranches of rating classifications in one tradable security .
This has been enormously profitable , as I imagine you noticed .
I have .
The firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day .
Now the problem , which is , I guess , why we are here tonight , is that is takes us , the firm , about a month to layer these products correctly , thereby posing a challenge from a Risk Management standpoint .
And , Mr. Sullivan , that challenge is ?
We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to .
Yes .
But the key factor here is these are essentially just mortgages .
So that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do in any other circumstance , thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags .
Now ...
Thank you , Mr. Sullivan .
Sit down .
What I 'm guessing your report here says , and give me some rope here .
What I 'm guessing it says is that considering the , shall we say , bumpy road we 've been on the last week or so , that the figures your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you have come up with don 't make much sense anymore considering what 's taking place today .
Actually , not what 's taking place today , but what 's already taken place over the last two weeks .
So , you 're saying this has already happened ?
Sort of .
Sort of .
And , Mr. Sullivan , what does your model say that , that means for us here .
Well , that 's where it becomes a projection .
But ...
You 're speaking with me , Mr. Sullivan .
Well , sir , if those assets decrease by just 25 % and remain on our books , that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this entire company .
So , what you 're telling me is that the music is about to stop and we 're going to be left holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism .
Sir , I 'm not sure that I would put it that way .
But let me clarify .
Using your analogy , what this model shows is the music , so to speak , just slowing .
If the music were to stop , as you put it , then this model wouldn 't be even close to that scenario .
It would be considerably worse .
Let me tell you something , Mr. Sullivan .
Do you care to know why I 'm in this chair with you all ?
I mean , why I earn the big bucks ?
Yes .
I 'm here for one reason and one reason alone .
I 'm here to guess what the music might do a week , a month , a year from now .
That 's it .
Nothing more .
And standing here tonight ,
I 'm afraid that I don 't hear a thing .
Just silence .
So , now that we know the music has stopped , what can we do about it ?
Mr. Cohen ?
Ms. Robertson ?
I 'm afraid I think this is where you 're supposed to step back in .
Lord knows we 've relied enough on Mr. Sullivan tonight .
What do you have for us ?
What have I told you since the first day you stepped into my office ?
There are three ways to make a living in this business , be first , be smarter , or cheat .
Now , I don 't cheat .
And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people in this building , it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first .
Sell it all .
Today .
Is that even possible , Sam ?
Yes , but at what cost ?
I 'll have to pay .
Really ?
I think so .
Where is this going to come back to us ?
Everywhere .
Sam , I don 't think you seem to understand what your boy here has just said .
If I made you , how would you do this ?
You call the traders in for their normal 6 : 30 meeting and you be honest with them .
Because they 're going to know it 's the end either way .
You 're going to have to throw them a bone , and a pretty big one .
And then you 've got to come out of the gates storming .
No swaps .
No nothing .
40 % done by 10 : 15 .
By 11 : 00 , all your trades have to be gone because by lunchtime , word 's going to be out .
And by 2 : 00 you 're going to be selling at 65 cents on the dollar , if you 're lucky .
And then the feds are going to be in here , up your ass , trying to slow you down .
Ramesh ?
They can slow you down .
They can 't stop you .
It 's yours to sell .
But , John , even if we manage to pull that off , and that 's saying something , the real question is , who are we selling this to ?
Same people we 've been selling it to the last two years , and whoever else will buy it .
But , John , if you do this , you will kill the market for years .
It 's over .
And you 're selling something that you know has no value .
We are selling to willing buyers of the current fair market price .
So that we may survive .
You will never sell anything to any of those people ever again .
I understand .
Do you ?
Do you ?
This is it !
I 'm telling you .
This is it .
Now , it 's 4 : 00 .
Jared , you 've got till 5 : 00 to break this down and draw me up a plan .
Is there anybody else who knows what 's in here at the moment , block by block ?
Eric Dale .
And where is he ?
As of today , he 's no longer with the firm .
We have been trying to locate him .
Carmelo .
Yes .
Get me Eric Dale here by 6 : 30 .
It 's done .
We meet back here in an hour .
Sam , let 's talk .
This is a hell of a town .
I 've always loved this place , since the day I arrived .
Everything about it .
Sam , are you going to go with me on this ?
I don 't know , John .
This one is very ugly .
You and I , we 're salesmen .
We sell .
That 's what we do .
It 's not complicated .
Exactly .
And you know damn well you don 't sell anything to anybody unless you think they 're gonna come back for more .
That 's the lesson we learned .
And tomorrow , we 're done .
But this is it , Sam .
You keep saying that .
What 's that supposed to mean ?
This is the big one .
Most of us aren 't going to make it out of this one .
Us ?
The Street .
What are you talking about ?
This isn 't the last situation I 'm gonna have to deal with this week .
This is just the start .
It 's the start 'cause you 're starting it .
Maybe .
But I don 't believe that .
Not this time .
The numbers , they just don 't add up anymore .
I agree with you there .
I 've been saying that for years .
If this kid out there can come up with this , then ...
Look , I just don 't think I can walk in there knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys .
When did you start getting so soft , Sam ?
Fuck you , soft .
You 're panicking .
If you 're the first out of the door , that 's not called panicking .
You 're obviously operating with more information than I have .
But I think this will destroy this firm .
No one will ever trust you again .
You 're knowingly putting people out of business , full stop .
You let me deal with that , Sam .
How 'd it go ?
This is a fucking shit show .
They 're gonna go with it ?
Probably .
Jesus .
Remember this day , boys .
Remember this day .
So , what 's the strategy here ?
That 's where I 'm headed right now .
Downstairs to work on it with my guys .
No , no .
You and I with John .
I 'm not sure that we need one , Sarah .
That 's not the way I do things .
Please .
Listen , he knows where we 've stood on this all along .
That 's exactly my point .
And knowing what was discussed by both you and I ,
I don 't see how this could provide you with anything other than a false sense of comfort .
I 'm not looking for a sense of comfort here , Sarah .
I don 't think there 's one to be found .
So , again , what 's the strategy here ?
I 'm just not sure there 's much more to do on this .
It 's very simple .
Don 't even think about fucking me on this .
' Cause if we 're going down , then you damn well know it 'll be together .
No .
I 'm not sure that I do know that .
Hey .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
What do you guys think Tuld made last year ?
Would you shut the fuck up ?
86 million .
In bonuses and salary .
Really ?
Sure , it 's public record .
That is a lot of fucking money .
He was worth a billion .
Was ?
Till today .
Really ?
You 'll see .
I 'm going to get some coffee .
You guys want anything else ?
I 'm all right .
I could use some real air .
Probably a good idea .
Is it all right , Will ?
Is what all right ?
Lf I get out of here for a minute ?
Of course , it 's not a prison .
You want me to hold your hand ?
Why did they put all this fruit on it ?
Hello , Will Emerson .
Hello .
Right .
No , thank you .
I understand .
No , we 'll be discreet .
Thank you .
What ?
Eric 's wife .
He 's alive , he 's home , he doesn 't want to speak to us , and he doesn 't know that she rang me .
Where 's he live ?
Heights .
Shall I call Tuld 's guy ?
No .
It 's Eric .
The last thing we need is those guys going over there .
No , you two go get him and try to bring him here .
But you got to be back by 6 : 00 a . m .
All right .
I hate Brooklyn .
May I come in ?
Of course .
Please , sit down .
So ...
We 're going to do this thing .
Okay .
It 's going to be tight .
Is Sam on board ?
Not yet .
Sarah ,
I need a head to feed to the traders on the floor and the board .
Is it me or Cohen ?
It 's you .
Of course , you 're well aware that I filtered several warnings to you and Cohen about this a year ago .
I really don 't think that 's the best path for you to take at this point .
You 're going to be well taken care of here .
Obviously , it is quite complicated .
John , I was told under no uncertain terms ...
It was always a very gray area .
Actually , it was made very clear at the time by you , me , and Cohen .
I 'd really appreciate it if you didn 't fight me on this .
We all fucked this one up pretty good .
Yes .
We need you to stay here until this is finished and the market 's closed .
I understand .
They 'll go over the numbers with you downstairs .
Good luck .
Oh , fuck .
Jared 's coming .
What 's the boy wonder want ?
You got a minute ?
Just off to pick up Eric .
Yeah .
I know .
It will only take a second .
All right , what is it ?
Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here .
This has never been a problem .
No , it hasn 't .
But sometimes , in acute situations such as this , often what is right can take on multiple interpretations .
Sam will step up .
Oh , I know he will .
But if he doesn 't ...
But if he doesn 't , we need to know that you will .
Thank you .
You need to know that I will what ?
That you 'll step up .
I have no doubt that Sam will make the right decision .
But just to make it clear , he and I have always had the same interpretation of what 's right , no matter how acute the situation .
Jesus , that 's a nice place .
Yeah , it is .
He just bought it .
I hope it was with cash .
Fuck me , you 're a heartless little shit sometimes .
And it wasn 't .
Don 't touch any of the buttons .
What are you doing here ?
Hey .
So , Peter finished the model you were working on .
Really ?
It caused a shit storm .
I bet it did .
You think he 's right ?
I know he 's right .
Fuck .
All right .
So Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting with the senior partners last night .
And based on your findings , they 've decided to liquidate our entire position .
Today .
I 'm very sorry about that .
They 're worried about you being out here and they want me to bring you back .
Please .
I 'm just saying .
Fuck them .
Fuck them .
Eric ...
Don 't be rash .
Forget it .
I signed my paper .
I 'm out .
They 'll pay you .
They got nothing on me .
They 'll pay you .
I 've been paid enough already .
Fuck .
Do you know I built a bridge once ?
Sorry ?
A bridge .
No , I didn 't know that .
I was an engineer by trade .
It went from Dilles Bottom , Ohio , to Moundsville , West Virginia .
It spanned 912 feet above the Ohio River .
12, 100 people use this thing a day .
And it cut out 35 miles of extra driving each way between Wheeling and New Martinsville .
That 's a combined 847, 000 miles of driving a day .
Or 25, 410, 000 miles a month .
And 304, 920, 000 miles a year saved .
Now , I completed that project in 1986 .
That 's 22 years ago .
So over the life of that one bridge , that 's 6, 708, 240, 000 miles that haven 't had to be driven at ...
What ?
Let 's say 50 miles an hour .
So that 's what ?
That 's 134, 164, 800 hours .
Or 559, 020 days .
So that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1, 531 years of their lives not wasted in a fucking car .
1, 531 years .
Jesus .
I guess you better get back over there .
Yeah .
Thanks for coming by .
You 're welcome .
Who the fuck is this ?
I would imagine it 's the firm 's people .
What ?
They don 't want any loose ends .
They fired me .
Fuck them .
Fuck them .
I totally agree .
Fuck them .
So come back , take the money , you 'll be home by 5 : 00 .
Otherwise , they 're going to fight you on everything .
They 're going to fight you on your package , your options , everything .
Be smart .
Well , you 're a better man than me .
That 's always been true .
Yes , it has .
House looks good .
Thanks .
Hey , Eric .
Don 't beat yourself up too much about this stuff , all right ?
Some people like driving the long way home .
Who the fuck knows , right ?
There he is .
John .
How 's it looking ?
Cohen 's doing a nice job .
It could work .
What does that mean ?
It means , as you very well know , that you 're a very important piece of this puzzle .
That 's very generous .
It 's not a gift .
I need to know you 're with me on this .
I 'm with the firm , John .
I won 't get what I need from your boys on the floor unless they believe you .
Unless they believe in you completely .
Are you in on this ?
I 've told you my reservations .
You can 't have reservations .
And I need to know now .
Well , John , I am completely with the firm , as I always have been .
Excuse me .
All right , Will , am I getting fired ?
I don 't know .
Yeah .
Almost definitely .
Yes .
Are you ?
No .
Seth , it 's nothing you did .
You 're just in the wrong firm at the wrong time .
Young guys are always the first to get culled .
Listen , nothing I 'm gonna say is going to make you feel any better .
It 's just going to suck for a while , and then you 'll be fine .
You all right ?
Yeah .
I 'm fine .
For what it 's worth , I 'm sorry this is happening to you .
Don 't be .
You didn 't do it to me .
Still , at least you 're going to have some nice cash to walk away with .
I guess .
Shit , this is really going to affect people .
Yeah , it 's going to affect people like me .
No .
No .
Real people .
Jesus , Seth .
Listen , if you really want to do this with your life , you have to believe you 're necessary .
And you are .
People want to live like this , in their cars and the big fucking houses they can 't even pay for , then you 're necessary .
The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is because we 've got our fingers on the scales in their favor .
I take my hand off , then the whole world gets really fucking fair really fucking quickly , and nobody actually wants that .
They say they do , but they don 't .
They want what we have to give them , but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from .
That 's more hypocrisy than I 'm willing to swallow .
So fuck ...
Fuck normal people .
The funny thing is , tomorrow , if all of this goes tits up they 're going to crucify us for being too reckless .
But if we 're wrong and everything gets back on track , then the same people are going to laugh till they piss their pants ,
' cause we 're gonna look like the biggest pussies
God ever let through the door .
You think we 're going to be wrong ?
No , they 're all fucked .
Good morning .
Peter .
You want one ?
I don 't smoke .
Oh , that 's good .
I don 't much either .
You tired ?
Of what ?
Remember , I don 't work as hard as you .
That 's not true .
No , it is , actually .
We all getting fired tonight ?
Probably .
Are they going to fire you ?
They won 't exactly call it that .
It 'll be a mercy killing , really .
You don 't have to stand out here for me .
No , I don 't really want to go back in there just yet .
I understand that .
I think I know your son .
Really ?
Not well , but he always seemed like a nice person .
He is a nice person .
I guess you could say worse things about a guy .
Does he know what 's about to happen ?
What do you mean ?
Did you talk to him ?
No , I hadn 't even thought ...
They are all coming in now .
Yes , they are .
Have you ever done anything like this ?
No , never .
Not even close .
Yeah .
Are you sure it 's the only , or the right thing to do ?
For who ?
I 'm not sure .
Neither am I.
Oh , God .
You all right ?
You 're about to fire me .
This is all I ever wanted to do .
Really ?
They 're almost ready for you , Ms. Robertson .
Couple of minutes .
You as well ?
Yes .
Jesus .
Yeah .
Sorry .
Thank you .
I didn 't think they were going to be able to get you back here .
Well , they told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything over the next two years , my options , my health care .
Or I could come back here and make $176, 471 an hour to sit quietly in this room .
Didn 't seem like much of a choice .
It never is .
Obviously , looking back , it was expressed with insufficient urgency , but your point was passed on .
I need you to know that .
Eric .
It 's okay .
I understand .
Believe me .
There was nothing else you could have done .
I guess .
At the time , it didn 't seem like there was much of a choice .
It never does .
You have kids , yeah ?
So , what 's your package going to be like ?
I don 't know .
That 's what I 'm waiting for now .
It 's probably going to be pretty good .
It better be .
Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning .
I know yesterday was pretty bad , and I wish I could say that today 's gonna be less so , but that isn 't going to be the case .
Now , I 'm supposed to read this statement to you all here .
But why don 't you just read it on your own time , and I 'll just tell you what the fuck is going on here .
I 've been here all night meeting with the executive committee , and the decision has been made to unwind a considerable portion of the firm 's holdings and several key asset classes .
The crux of it is , in the firm 's thinking , the party is over as of this morning .
There 's gonna be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future , and they believe it is better that this turmoil begin with us .
As a result , the firm has decided to liquidate its majority position of fixed income MBS today .
These are your packets .
You will see what accounts you 're responsible for today .
I 'm sure it hasn 't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and , as a result , on your careers .
I have expressed this reality to the executive committee , and they understand .
As a result , if you achieve a 93 % sale of your assets , you will receive a $1 . 4 million one- off bonus .
If the floor as a whole achieves a 93 % sale , you will get an additional $1 . 3 million apiece .
For those of you who have never been through this before , this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like .
I cannot begin to tell you how important the first hour and a half is gonna be .
I want you to hit every bite you can find .
Dealers , brokers , clients .
Your mother , if she 's buying .
And , no swaps .
It 's outgoing only .
Today .
Obviously , this is not going down the way that any of us would have hoped .
But the ground is shifting below our feet , and apparently there 's no other way out .
Guys , this is obviously a very , very unique situation .
If we are successful today , we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs .
I cannot promise that any of you , all of you , some of you will be repositioned within the firm .
But I can tell you that I am very proud of the work that we have done here together .
I 've been at this place 34 years , and I can tell you from experience that people are going to say some very nasty things about what we do here today and about what you 've dedicated a portion of your lives to .
But , have faith that in the bigger picture , our skills have not been wasted .
We have accomplished much , and our talents have been used for the greater good .
Here 's your packets .
Get to work .
City , this is Eric .
Give me Elliot .
City .
Hey , it 's Will Emerson .
William , how are you ?
I 'm all right .
How 's the trouble and strife ?
Busting my ass , as always .
You see , that 's what I tried to tell you , John .
Why do you think I 'm single ?
I know you did .
What can I do for you ?
Listen .
I just got the tap on my shoulder , and we 've got some risk over here that we need to move .
So today it looks like my loss is your gain .
What kind of size are we talking ?
It should be on your screen .
I just sent it .
Jesus !
Where does this land ?
96 on the dollar .
91 .
All three and we 're done at 94 .
Ninety- three and a half .
Done .
Trading .
Hello , gorgeous .
Will , what 's happening over there ?
Well , today 's moving day .
Fuck are you guys so worked up about ?
You think they tell me anything ?
All I know is that today , my loss is your gain .
Now you 're a friendly , so I 've come to you first .
I got 270 mil at 15 year paying out a point and a half above par .
Where 's it from ?
Where 's it from ?
Do you care ?
No , not really .
Now , where 's the trade ?
I 'm hearing things ...
Alexis ...
You guys are scaring me a little .
I 'm only sharing this with you right now .
85 .
Done .
Deutsche .
It 's Will Emerson .
Fuck you , you limey bastard .
Come on , are you still angry about that ?
Word is out .
I 'm hanging up now .
Merrill .
Lawrence !
What the fuck are you guys doing over there ?
Just a little spring cleaning .
That is not what I 'm hearing .
All right , Lawrence , are you a buyer ?
I 'm not sure anymore .
Where at ?
Well , it sounds like I should be asking you where at .
What are we talking about here ?
Three hundred seventy- five mil at 30 year mixed .
Fuck me .
Are you with me on this ?
Sixty- three cents .
Oh , fuck you .
I 'm hanging up .
Sixty- three .
Let me call my man here .
I 'll come back to you in five .
It may be 55 in 5 .
Well , all right , then .
Stay on the line .
Sam , pick up the phone .
Sam , get on the line !
Yeah .
I got Lawrence at Merrill .
Where are we ?
Sixty- three cents .
Jesus .
On what ?
375 mix 30 .
Get him to 65 and hit it .
Are you fucking kidding me ?
That 's ...
What is that ?
That 's a $131 million loss on a single trade .
I understand .
Hit it .
Hey , Lawrence .
We 're fill or kill at 65 .
It 's filled .
Well done .
I just want to give you a heads up .
They 're going to start sending a few people home now .
Now ?
Yes , Sam .
No loose ends .
Of course .
And for what it 's worth , you 're still good .
Yeah , I guess someone upstairs really likes you .
Sam .
Please , sit .
Congratulations are clearly in order .
They did the best they could .
You did a hell of a job .
And I thank you for it .
Come on , sit .
Excuse me for eating , but it 's been a long day .
Can I get you something ?
No , nothing .
Thanks .
So , what can I do for you ?
I want out .
I 'm done .
I want out .
It 's been a very difficult day for everyone .
I need you to release my options , if they 're worth anything after today .
I want my bonus .
I 'm out .
You 'll get your bonus , your options , and keep your current base .
But I need you to stay with me for the next 24 months , okay ?
Oh , come on , Sam .
Put a smile on your face .
You did some good today .
You said that yourself .
Do you know , I 'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing .
You 're one of the luckiest guys in the world , Sam .
Could have been digging ditches all these years .
That 's true .
And if I had , at least there 'd be some holes in the ground to show for it .
Jesus .
I just don 't know how we fucked this up quite so much .
When did you start feeling so sorry for yourself ?
It 's unbearable .
What ?
So you think we might have put a few people out of business today .
That 's all for naught .
But you 've been doing that every day for almost 40 years , Sam .
And if this is all for naught , then so is everything out there .
It 's just money .
It 's made up , pieces of paper with pictures on it so that we don 't have to kill each other just to get something to eat .
It 's not wrong .
And it 's certainly no different today than it 's ever been .
1637 , 1797 , 1819 , 1837 , 1857 , 1884 ,
1901 , 1907 , 1929 , 1937 , 1974 , 1987 , Jesus .
Didn 't that fucker fuck me up good .
1992 , 1997 , 2000 , and whatever we want to call this .
It 's all just the same thing , over and over .
We can 't help ourselves .
And you and I can 't control it or stop it or even slow it .
Or even ever so slightly alter it .
We just react .
And we make a lot of money if we get it right .
And we get left by the side of the road if we get it wrong .
And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers , happy fucks and sad sacks , fat cats and starving dogs in this world .
Yeah .
There may be more of us today than there 's ever been .
But the percentages , they stay exactly the same .
I 'll do it , John , but not because of your little speech .
But because I need the money .
Hard to believe after all these years , but I need the money .
This is the executive dining room .
Do you want coffee or tea ?
No .
You gonna keep the kid ?
Keep him ?
He 's getting promoted .
It 's all hands on deck now , Sam .
There 's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess , and we 're gonna need all the brains we can get around here .
Hello .
I 've called the police .
Mary .
Sam .
Yep .
What are you doing ?
Sam , what are you doing ?
Ella died .
I was driving home from the vet and I couldn 't think of where else to go .
She belongs here .
I know .
But , Sam , you don 't live here anymore .
Are you all right ?
You don 't look so good .
Yeah , it 's been a rough day all the way around .
I know , Sammy called .
Is he all right ?
They got hammered , but they got out alive .
Good .
Well , I 'm gonna go back inside and go back to bed .
The alarm is on , so don 't try and break in .
Take care of yourself .
â™ª â™ª
Come here .
Son of a ...
Get back here .
No , don 't -- don 't -- all right , all right .
No , wait !
Don 't you --
I- I 've got --
I 've ...
Got ...
Ha !
I got you .
I --
Talk to me , Goose .
Goose ?
Yeah , I 'm -- I 'm Maverick .
Get it ?
No .
" Tower , this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby " ?
You know , it kind of takes the fun out of things if I have to explain it .
Oh , I can see how that could happen .
Right .
Did you find Grant 's flask ?
Sort of .
There 's just , um ...
One thing .
One ?
Try hundreds .
Hundreds and hundreds of things .
Agh !
We 're looking for a flask at a Civil War reenactment .
A place where all flasks go to die .
A world where everyone has a flask .
Hey , that sounds like cannon fire .
Brilliant .
There 's that college education rearing its head .
What do you want , and why did you call me ?
Oh , right .
Urgent .
Do you know where Artie keeps the tiny little marshmallows ?
' Cause he won 't tell me .
Like he needs marshmallows , right ?
Hey , Pete ?
Yeah .
Yeah , you know , that Artie .
He 's -- he 's looking pretty good these days , don 't you think ?
It 's all the exercise I get chasing artifacts without any help .
Ahh ... Ahh ...
Ah- choo !
Sorry .
I 'm sorry .
Oh , man , Artie .
That cold sounds like it 's getting worse .
You should be resting .
It 's a very good idea , resting .
If only I were paying somebody to help me with this kind of thing .
I know , right ?
Well , Claudia 'll be back soon .
Yeah .
Who made this thing ?
Tch .
Talk to me , Goose .
Huh ?
What , did no one see
Pete , there 's someone here to meet you .
Oh , yeah .
Sorry , Leena .
I 'm kinda busy right now .
She says she 's your ex- wife , Pete .
Ah- choo !
Pete ?
Original Air Date on August 1 , 2011 == sync , corrected by ==
Hey , Myka .
27 hours to Dubai .
I 'm back .
And I know , I know that I should 've gone to the warehouse first , but --
Myka .
I needed B& B and my bed .
Myk --
How did this even get to Dubai anyway ?
I mean , it 's not like Dubai looks like Dakota on the packing slip , okay ?
And -- Is that me ?
Oh , my God , I smell .
I smell , don 't I ?
Okay , so shower .
Shower and then nap and then warehouse .
But Myka , I have somebody that I 'd like you to meet .
Myka , this is Amanda .
Amanda Lattimer .
Nice to meet you .
Hi .
Oh , it 's -- it 's so nice to meet you .
I 'm Myka Bering .
Amanda Lattimer .
Well , you 're not Pete 's ... ... Mom .
And you 're not his sister , ' cause his sister -- but are you -- are you his cousin ?
No , no .
I 'm not his cousin .
And I 'll be changing the name .
I 'm his --
Amanda .
Amanda .
And -- and -- and Myka , you 're back .
And -- and you guys --
You guys have met .
Ohhh , that 's great .
Well , Amanda new- last- name was just telling me that she 's your not- cousin .
She 's not .
That 's right .
Um , Amanda , Myka 's ...
Probably really tired , and --
No , I 'm fine .
I 'm --
Needs to shower .
What ?
So let 's , uh , step over this way , shall we ?
But I- I would --
Oh , here we go .
Look at this room .
I would --
I would just like to properly welcome your --
That 's rude .
Okay , spill .
So what are you doing in the middle of South Dakota , Marine ?
Oh , uh , I got -- I got reassigned .
Reassigned .
Mm- hmm .
Here , from D. C. mm- hmm .
That 's a punishment .
What 'd you do this time ?
No , no , no , no .
No , no .
Oh , please .
No , I --
No , I didn 't do anything .
Mm- hmm .
Well , no , wait .
I -- that 's -- let me --
I did something , but it was a good thing , okay ?
That 's why I 'm here .
Whatever it was , I 'm sure it wasn 't intentional .
Uh , no , it wa -- it 's a -- it was -- it 's a promotion .
A promotion to " You- nee- ville . "
" Uhn- eh- ville . "
And what are you doing in Univille , anyway ?
Oh .
Oh .
I found something that belongs to you .
Shut it .
Whoo- hoo- hoo !
first edition ?
Ha , ha , ha !
Okay , how do you do that ?
And just like that , you 're a 12- year- old boy .
Ohhh .
I never thought that I would see this again .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
Okay .
Ah , man .
Anyway , so I should , um --
I should go .
Yeah ?
Yeah .
Okay .
Okay .
Hey , Amanda .
Yeah ?
Are you gonna tell me why you 're really here ?
It 's disconcerting how well we know each other , isn 't it ?
Um ...
I 'm getting remarried .
W- wow .
Remarried ?
That 's awesome .
That 's amaz -- that 's terrific .
Thanks .
Congratulations .
So when is the wedding ?
Tomorrow , actually .
It 's tomorrow !
That 's -- oh , that 's -- tomorrow .
I would 've told you sooner , but apparently , I have to get clearance to talk to my ex- husband now .
You have no idea the kind of governmental hoops
I had to jump through to get here .
You know what ?
I don 't know if I can ...
Get away on such short notice .
Oh , sorry , Pete .
I , um --
I didn 't come here to invite you .
I came to get my grandfather 's ring .
Oh .
The ring .
The ring , that 's right .
You know what ?
I still have that , don 't I ?
I 'm sorry .
No , no , no , no , no .
No , please , I -- let me , uh -- it 's , um -- it 's upstairs .
I 'll go get it , okay ?
Ah -- ah- choo !
Bless you .
Oh .
Oh , hi .
Uh , sorry .
I- I was just looking for --
Pete 's wife .
I mean , you 're -- uh , ex- wife .
Pete 's ex- wife that we actually didn 't know he had .
Just Amanda would be fine .
And you are ?
Oh , sorry .
I 'm , uh -- I 'm sorry .
Ar -- Arthur .
Artie .
You don 't want to -- uh , I- I was actually just looking for , um , Myka .
I was looking -- or Leena .
Leena would do .
How 'bout me ?
Would I do ?
Oh , hi .
Hi !
He 's -- I wasn 't --
I was looking for --
Me !
He was looking for me because I 'm back .
Right , exactly .
She 's back .
I wanted to welcome her back .
Well , now you 've seen her .
Yeah .
You 've seen her .
She 's seen you .
Everybody 's seen everybody .
So now everybody is gonna go .
Here we go .
Out the do ' .
Buh- bye .
So long .
Atta boy .
Nothing to see .
Nothing to see .
All right , all right .
Married ?
You were married ?
I don 't believe you .
Can 't I have any privacy around here ?
And you -- - Me ?
Sneaking around .
I 'm not sneaking .
There was no sneaking .
Sneaking !
Married .
I mean , how long --
Okay , okay , okay .
Show 's over .
He is absolutely right .
Myka , I am ashamed of you .
Nosing around like that .
This man -- this man needs his privacy .
Huh- huh .
Married .
Ah- choo !
Bless you .
How could you not --
Go .
What ?
Upstairs , now .
Go , go , go , go .
Sorry about that .
They 're , uh -- I was gonna say " Butt pains , " but okay .
Oh .
Uh ...
So this is it , huh ?
Our , uh , our reason for seeing each other .
Well , I guess this is it .
Uh , look , Amanda .
You pretty much missed out on the whole amends part of my life .
I mean , not -- not that you were exactly around , either .
So I guess I --
I guess I never thought that I was gonna have to do this .
And now that I hear it out loud , it ...
Sounds like such a cop- out .
The thing is , um , the reason that I never have ...
Is because you 're the hardest one to make amends to .
I really screwed us up .
Amanda , I 'm sorry .
Thanks .
And listen , Pete , it 's -- it 's water under the bridge .
And I think everything worked out for the best .
I guess so .
Now what about this guy ?
What 's -- it 's not -- it 's not anyone I know , is it ?
Of course not .
Oh , God , thanks for that .
He 's the one , though , huh ?
Yeah , he really is .
I mean , not that you weren 't .
It 's just -- it 's different this time .
You know , Michael , he 's sweet and charming --
You had me at yes .
Shhhht .
So let 's -- -- shut 'er down .
Oh , I 'm just -- I 'm just excited about the wedding .
I know .
You know , fairy tale and castle .
I mean , it 's a rented castle in the Poconos , but still .
Um , I 've been one of a few good men for a long time , so I 'm ready to just be a princess for a day .
Well , you deserve it .
The prince and the fairy tale .
All of it .
Thanks , Pete .
Yeah .
Be happy , Amanda .
I will be .
â™ª â™ª
Well , why was she here ?
Alimony ?
Are you two striking up the band again , or ...
What ?
No .
She 's getting remarried .
What ?
Why didn 't she just call ?
That doesn 't make sense at all .
Stop .
That 's why I didn 't tell you , okay ?
I don 't want to talk about it .
Ah ...
Pete , you 're -- you 're right .
Ah- choo !
I 'm sorry .
Your private life is none of our business .
We shouldn 't have intruded .
You know ...
It wasn 't just one thing .
I mean , mostly , it was because we were ...
Just too young .
Least , I was too young .
Amanda was -- I mean , she was very driven .
She always knew exactly what she wanted .
It 's what the Marines call a- a hard charger .
Oh , man .
She was ... ... Amazing .
I mean , of course she 's a Major now .
And -- and I ... ... was not amazing .
I- I didn 't know what I wanted , and I definitely wasn 't ready for a lifetime commitment .
I mean , not then .
Now I- I just wonder .
If it could 've worked ?
Yeah .
No .
Maybe .
No .
Uh , people ?
We have a problem .
One beehive , one bee .
We are missing the bee .
I don 't know what the bee does , but if it was in Warehouse 2 , we can bet it was probably something bizarre and deadly .
We 'd better find it now .
Okay , look .
I- I came in here .
And I put the beehive right here .
Right , right .
I remember because --
You gasped .
You rarely gasp .
Pete 's right .
Why did you gasp ?
Leena ?
Amanda .
Amanda 's bag was right there .
Pollen .
If Amanda somehow triggered the latch ...
Then the bee ...
Could 've fallen right into --
No !
No , no , no , no , no !
An artifact did not fall into my ex- wife 's bag on her way to her perfect fairy- tale wedding .
No , that did not happen .
Artie 's law of artifacts states the worst thing that can happen with an artifact will happen with an artifact .
It 's in Amanda 's bag .
Now you can panic .
Amanda .
Hey .
There 's my future husband .
Hi .
Welcome back .
I missed you .
I missed you , too .
Oh , look , I got the ring .
Great .
Ow !
You all right ?
Yeah , just ...
Oh , there 's the bride at last .
And I need to talk to you about the caterer .
I think he 's a complete idiot .
Okay .
Guess I 'll see you at the altar .
Whew .
Fire !
And after the whole hoopla with the inter- dimensional space ,
I realized what I really wanted was to be a Warehouse Agent .
So what about you ?
What 's your story ?
You know my story .
A. T. F. , Jimi Hendrix ' guitar , and the first time I saw Artie 's eyebrows .
No , I mean , like , before all that .
Well , before all that is the past .
Which is where I 'd like to keep it .
Oh , well , word of warning :
At the warehouse , the past doesn 't always stay in the past .
Literally .
Did I mention we have a time machine ?
Why doesn 't that surprise me ?
Look , it isn 't here .
Are you sure ?
Silver flasks , gold flasks , wooden flasks , flasks with flaps , flasks with knobs .
I get it .
Lotta flasks .
Look , we 've been through this trunk twice , and none of them match the description , so why don 't we just shut this whole shindig down ?
We 'll flash badges , and we 'll body- search 'til we find it .
Because that 's not what we do .
I mean , Warehouse Agents , uh , we use stealth .
We 're stealthy .
I mean , can you imagine how these nut jobs would react when they find out that somebody has Ulysses S. Grant 's flask ?
The guys are carrying real bayonets !
Exactly , and if one of them drinks from it , and he starts believing that he 's fighting that war while he 's carrying a bayonet ,
Artie said at the last reenactment --
I know , the reenactor with the flask went postal and stabbed two soldiers .
I know , but we still use stealth .
Just really , really fast stealth .
So then what 's the plan , o stealthy one ?
I -- listen , I don 't exactly have a --
oh .
Why do I feel like Laverne ?
Oh , no , you 're not Laverne .
I 'm Laverne .
You 're Shirley .
Oh , I am not Shirley .
I 've been doing a little digging to find -- ah ...
Ah- choo !
Uh , to find out what this beehive artifact actually does .
I 'm a little rusty on my hieroglyphics , so -- and no age jokes , please .
So it make take me a little time .
Okay , Artie , just -- just let us know .
Wow .
This is a lot nicer than the " Love Me Tender " chapel in Vegas .
Oh , tell me you didn 't .
Oh , yeah , yeah .
That is the dress .
Oh , my gosh .
You were supposed to bring something blue .
Wait , wait , wait .
No , I was supposed to bring the garter .
No , I was supposed -- - You got it confused .
Ow .
Oh , Amanda , you look so beautiful .
This thing 's getting worse .
Look at that .
Oh , God , on your wedding day .
What did you do ?
That looks awful .
Amanda ...
You poor thing .
I 'll get you a band- aid .
Triple antibiotic .
You need triple antibiotic .
Okay .
Ten- hut !
Marines !
Major !
Amanda .
You look great , Major .
I 'm so glad you made it .
Sir , you look fantastic .
Oh , thanks , guys .
It 's ma 'am .
So glad you guys are here .
You should sit down and rest , Major .
Put your feet up .
No , I 'm okay , thanks .
You need to conserve your energy .
I 'll get you a chair .
No , I 'm good , guys .
Excuse me .
Pete -- uh , Myka , right ?
What are you doing here ?
Wow .
You -- you -- you look -- wow .
Amanda , we 're really sorry to intrude , but , uh --
We have a little problem .
Um , can we talk to you for a minute ?
So what 's with the parade ?
Is this what happens when you become an officer ?
It 's the bridal party .
Marines take their job seriously .
I was a Marine .
I was never a stalker .
Okay , is there somewhere we can talk privately ?
Oh .
So exciting .
Oh , no , it 's Mike 's parents .
His mother doesn 't know how to end a sentence ,
let alone a conversation .
Just do me a favor .
I have to talk to my friends for a minute , so just take care of the Martins for me , all right ?
I don 't care what you have to do .
Just keep 'em away from me .
Let 's go in here .
Hello .
What 's going on ?
Is this some sort of Marine thing ?
We 're looking for our son .
Oof !
Oh , no !
So what is the problem ?
We can 't tell you .
Why not ?
We can 't tell you .
It 's just that when you were at the B & B , something got loose .
Got loo -- what kind of something ?
Uh , we can 't tell you that , either .
Pete , if this is about me getting remarried --
Wait , wait , whoa .
What ?
No , okay ?
Scout 's honor .
You were kicked out of the scouts when you were ten .
I did not start that fire .
Look , Amanda , trust me .
This isn 't about you .
Then why are you here ?
Look , it 's need- to- know , Major .
And you don 't need to know .
Fine , fine .
Whatever this problem is , what are you gonna do to fix it ?
Or can you not tell me that , either ?
We just need to search your bag .
It 's actually that bag .
Pete ?
It 's a great dress .
Really .
Sorry .
My Sandy Alomar Junior signed baseball ?
Backup plan .
I wasn 't sure the comic book would work .
So does this have something to do with your new job ?
Why you 're in " you- nee- ville " ?
" Uh- neh- ville . "
So you weren 't lying .
It really is a promotion .
Ha- ha !
Ha , ha , ha !
Behold !
Bee- hold .
Bee- hold , I -- - Yeah .
All right , yeah .
Um , you might , uh , you might wanna duck .
Welp , there you go .
Bam .
Well , no dead bodies , no mass destruction , no swarm of killer bees , although I gotta tell ya , it did cross my mind .
So much for Artie 's law .
What was that ?
Some kind of weapon ?
Uh , that is your wedding being saved .
Okay , so the good news is , is that it is over .
All right , then .
Thank you for ...
Taking care of whatever that was .
Yeah , yeah .
Um , no worries .
Listen , uh , we 're sorry to barge in like that .
And , uh , you shalln 't see me again .
Pete .
Um , could I talk to you for a second ?
I 'm gonna go see if there 's a moat .
I hope there 's a moat because I really --
I love the -- the moats .
She loves moats .
Chaaarrrge !
Well , now that we 're stealthy , do you have any ideas how to find this flask in a haystack ?
I don 't know , mingle ?
See if there 's anyone here taking this whole reenactment business too seriously ?
Run , ya scurvy yanks , run !
I kinda think showing up covers that category .
Okay , nix the negativity , all right , sand master ?
Think of it like when you were a kid , you know ?
Get into it .
Oh , what , there was no make- believe in your mysterious past ?
I say we hoist a musket and enter the fray .
And I say that we talk to that guy .
Did you know the guy who hit you ?
It was Private Johnson .
Guy went crazy right in the middle of a skirmish .
Started punchin ' other players and hitting 'em with the butt of his rifle .
I mean , we have rules against that sort of thing .
Was he drinking out of a flask ?
Well , I -- you know , I suppose so .
I mean , we all are .
It 's about half the fun .
You 're dead , rebel !
Huh ?
So are you , yank !
Long live Abe Lincoln !
What ?
I 'm getting into this .
Hey , lie down .
You 're dead .
Huh ?
No .
Oh , no , I 'm not dead .
I 'm just -- I 'm just wounded .
Yeah , oh , in the leg , I think .
Yeah , it 's -- it 's cool .
I can still fight .
Hey , do you know how much it cost to defoliate these trees to make it look like the Battle of Shiloh ?
We 're committed professionals .
And you , rebel dog , are dead .
All right .
Don 't get your long Johns in a bunch .
I 'm going .
So , now , if you 're dead , does that mean you 're still the Senior Agent here ?
Just find Johnson .
Look for the craziest guy out here .
So Pete ,
I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry , too .
What you said back at " you- nee- ville " --
" Uh- neh- ville . "
Stop that .
Right .
It wasn 't all your fault .
I -- it was easy at the time to blame your drinking , but ...
Takes two to screw up a tango .
Yeah , well , I was never really much of a Pacino .
I was more of a Tom Cruise , you know .
Yeah , you 're Maverick .
I remember .
Thank you .
The thing is ...
Back then , I just ...
I just wanted so much .
I wanted to do so much .
And I couldn 't let anything get in my way , including you .
Maybe if I hadn 't been so headstrong ...
Who knows ?
Yeah .
But hey .
Look at you now , Major .
Um , got your Cinderella dress .
I 've never seen you look happier .
I- I think -- I think things worked out exactly the way they were supposed to .
Amanda , have you seen my parents ?
I can 't find them anywhere .
Hey .
Hey .
Aren 't you -- isn 't he , uh --
Pete , yeah .
Pete .
Yes .
Glad you could make it .
Good to finally meet ya .
Oh , well , you just had to be nice , didn 't you ?
Pete was --
Listen , Michael , uh , you got yourself a fine little Major there , so .
Thank you .
Why don 't you and I go find your parents ?
Yeah .
I am just dying to chat with your mom .
So that was the groom , huh ?
Yeah , can you believe it ?
Well , your ex definitely has a type .
Uh , what ?
You think that guy looks like me , with the hair and the square jaw and the Captain America attitude ?
Please .
I 'm so much cooler than that .
It 's the weirdest thing .
My folks , they just disappeared .
We 'll find them , Michael , all right ?
Nobody gets in or out of here until we do .
I 'm gonna go look for them .
You just stay here and do whatever it is that brides do , okay ?
And when we find them , at exactly 1500 hours , come hell or high water or in- laws or exes , we are getting married .
And I 'll finally be Mrs. Michael Martin .
And I will finally own you , woman .
No one gets in or out of here .
I 'll finally own you , woman .
Come on , let 's go .
Okay .
Whoa , hi .
Excuse us .
Nobody in or out .
That 's what she said .
Okay .
Excuse u --
Look , Marines .
There 's no reason to get worked up here .
We were just leaving , and I --
Pete ?
I 'm all right .
No , no , I mean , Pete !
Nice hats .
Run !
â™ª â™ª
Help me !
Artie 's law .
Oh , yeah .
" It 's a wedding , Pete .
Why would we need our Teslas ? "
What is this , Pete ?
Where 'd the rest of them go ?
What the hell is happening ?
Michael is out there , and his parents .
I 'm sorry , but right now ,
I 'm worried about the guys with swords .
Spit it out , Lattimer .
I assume this is all being caused by your little top- secret whatever- it- is .
I told you , need- to- know .
Given that we 're being attacked by my own wedding party ,
I 'm pretty sure I need to know .
The beehive artifact once belonged to a female pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1479 B. C. E. ,
Hatshepsut .
Bless you .
Uh , what ?
No .
That wasn 't a sneeze .
That was the female pharaoh 's name , Hatshepsut .
So Hatshepsut created the artifact using the pheromones of honey bees .
Well , beehive , bee .
It makes sense .
Yes , and then she would prick herself with the bee and then inject the stinger , really , into her body .
She became the queen bee .
Precisely .
Ah- choo !
What about her ?
What about who ?
You -- you just said Hatshepsut .
Oh , no , that -- that was a sneeze .
Wait , you -- you said stinger .
Artie , you -- you did say stinger .
Okay , Artie , I 'm looking at this bee , and there is no stinger .
Fire !
Forward !
Die , scum !
Come on , you rebel dog !
Dude , what the hell ?
I shot you .
Come on , you rebel dog .
Fight like a man .
Come on , man , put the gun down .
I killed you .
You mock me , traitor .
But I shall be victorious for my great country !
No , no , no .
I have come to aid you , brother .
Together we will -- To hell with this .
Hey !
Johnson , listen .
I 'm not actually a reenactor .
The truth is you 've got something very dangerous .
Agh !
Die , scum !
Stop !
Stop , sir , I beg of you .
You would not raise your hand against a lady , would you ?
I would never harm a woman .
But I intend to kill this scurvy grayback .
' Fraid not .
Told you I was Laverne .
Such a Laverne move .
Come on , Shirley .
What ?
Oh , the mini- Tesla ?
It 's my own design .
It 's pretty cool , huh ?
Dude , that should be your drag name , Minnie Tesla .
Okay , they have these outfits for the female reenactors .
I figured if I could -- what ?
What ?
What 'd I do ?
No , uh , no , no , no , no .
It 's not -- it 's -- nothing , it 's not you .
It 's just that for a second there , you were a lot like my big sister .
You know , she used to save my butt a lot when we were little .
So you do have a past .
And a sister .
Well , tell .
What 's she like ?
Where 's she live ?
What 's she do ?
Details .
No , she ...
Well , she died , Claud , a while back .
How do I always do that with you ?
God , I 'm sorry , Jinksy .
It 's okay , really .
It 's , uh , it 's all good .
Right , well , let 's , um , snag it and bag it and get the hell outta here .
What all else do you have in there ?
I got a PB& J , if you 're hungry .
Forget I asked .
Damn Trekkies .
Always crashing the party , pretending they 're time- travelers .
Pft , what a nerd .
Tell me you found it .
Sort of .
Uh , Amanda 's been stung .
Did she touch anyone ?
Aside from her whole bridal party , no .
I 'm thinking the finger is the source of the infection , so don 't let her touch anyone else with it .
Artie , we checked her finger .
There 's no sign of the stinger .
Yeah , it makes its way through the body .
It targets the glands , and it causes the pheromone production .
And then , whenever she touches anyone , she immediately creates these worker bees who become slavishly devoted to her every need and protection .
Is that why they 're chasing us ?
Well , you know , probably .
Because you 're seen as a threat .
And -- oh , wait , wait , wait .
Yes , yes .
It appears that things went very badly for Hatshepsut .
You know , I 'm -- I- I must say ,
I 'm rather impressed with how quickly my , uh , hieroglyphic reading skills have come back to me .
Artie , just please figure out how to get the stinger out .
Consider it done .
I 'm gonna go find Michael .
Wait , no , no , no , no , no .
No , it 's too dangerous , okay ?
Everything 's gonna be fine .
I promise .
We 'll figure this out , even if I have to --
X- ray .
That 's what we 'll do .
We 'll X- ray her .
It 'll show us where the stinger is .
All we have to do is get her to the hospital , find the stinger , and get it out .
That 's great .
That 's a great idea .
I don 't suppose you packed any tear gas to get past the homicidal bridal party , did ya ?
I left it in my other pants .
Ugh !
â™ª â™ª
Stop , stop !
Stop !
What are they doing ?
What are they doing ?
Well , don 't look at it .
We 'll -- we 'll fix it later .
First we gotta get out of here .
Come on !
Those chairs are rented .
Amanda !
Come on !
Amanda !
Amanda !
Michael !
Mike -- stop !
Oof !
As your pharaoh -- pharaohess , I command you to stop !
Hup , hup , hup .
Obviously , that means something completely different in ancient Egyptian .
Hup , hup , hup .
Hup , hup , hup , hup , hup , hup .
Hup , hup , hup , hup , hup , hup .
Hup , hup , hup , hup , hup , hup ...
I give up .
When it comes to this --
Boogety- boogety ?
Yeah , when it comes to the boogety- boogety ,
I 'm pretty sure you outrank me .
Hey , Artie ?
Oh , Major , that 's so sweet .
All right , so what 's our plan ?
Plan ?
Right , right .
The -- the plan --
I will tell you the plan .
I just have to ask Myka a question first .
What 's the plan ?
So Artie , what 's the plan ?
Why wouldn 't they listen to their queen ?
Amanda gave them an order .
Well , Hatshepsut tried the same thing .
But by then , her subjects had become so obsessively devoted to her that they just took it on themselves to protect her from anyone .
Well , Michael 's her fiancÃ© .
Yes , well , her husband- to- be most of all , because as a male , he would have taken her place as pharaoh if they 'd gotten married .
What did they do to him ?
They ...
I think it says mummified him alive , but I 'm a little loopy from the cold medicine .
No !
Amanda , no !
That sounds bad .
Uh , call me back .
â™ª â™ª
Hey , look out !
Oof !
Ugh !
Oof !
Ohhhh !
Sandy .
Thanks .
Don 't thank me .
Go save my fiancÃ© .
That 's something you rarely hear your ex- wife say .
Ugh !
This time , stay down .
Shouldn 't you be seating people ?
Hey , look out !
Ten- hut !
Really ?
Ugh .
I found it !
Use the bee .
It 's a magnet .
It 'll draw the stinger out at her left clavicle .
Hey , hey , hey !
I said ten- hut !
About- face !
We 're on our own , kiddo .
Ugh !
Okay .
Now , this may hurt ...
Just a little .
And ...
Agh !
You know ,
I would have just sent you the ring .
Yeah .
Next time .
Next time ?
â™ª â™ª
There was a bit of a problem with the , um , the bridal party .
Mushrooms .
Yeah , yeah , uh , everybody ate wild mushrooms at their rehearsal brunch and kinda went on a bad trip , so it was , uh , ugh .
Yeah .
Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today ...
You know , I was really hoping I 'd hate you .
Pete !
Pete .
Ow , what ?
What I was trying to say was I wanted to hate him , but then I saw him take on those Marines with the chairs .
Hee !
Yah !
Kah !
It was -- it was epic .
This one -- this one right here -- distinguished valor in combat using rental furniture .
Ah .
Nice .
Okay , so this wasn 't exactly the , um , fairytale wedding that I had pictured , but it was , um , memorable .
Yes .
Thanks , Pete .
And listen , whatever it is that you two do , it 's exactly what you were meant to be doing .
You 're a good team .
All right , well , uh , at ease , Major .
Although I 'd have been a Colonel by now .
Oh .
Oh- ho- ho- ho .
Ohhh .
Yeah , what ?
Ouch , ouch .
Bye .
Bye .
And there we go .
Hey , uh ...
So listen , I- I just -- I want to say I 'm sorry for not telling you about Amanda .
I- I should 've .
No , it 's none of my business .
It wasn 't the marriage that I was trying to keep secret .
It was me .
Um , the guy I was before .
Pete the drunk .
Pete the loser .
You don 't have to --
No , Myka , it 's true .
It 's , um -- you 've never met that guy , and I don 't ever want you to .
You know , I just --
I want you and Artie and Claudia and everyone here to know the Pete I am now .
Fair enough .
Okay .
Hey -- hey , Pete .
That new husband , Michael ?
He 's a tool .
That 's , um ...
That 's why I joined the A. T. F.
I- I didn 't -- I was just --
I --
I 'm sorry .
I 'm really sorry , Steve .
It 's okay .
She , um ...
She was 20 .
She was your age .
I- I- I shouldn 't have been digging around .
You don 't have to talk about it if you don 't want to .
No , I think that I want to ,
Laverne .
You would 've liked her .
Yeah , I think you two would 've been good pals .
God , she was , um ...
Such a hero to me .
She was funny and smart , and she was always ...
Always there for me .
There was this one time ...
Geez , you know , I --
I think that you would 've done the exact same thing .
We were -- we were at the park .
We were shooting hoops .
She was , uh -- she was short , but she had this amazing layup .
And these kids came , and they were gonna beat the crap out of me , and she disappeared , and then all of a sudden ...
== sync , corrected by ==
Mick !
Mick , I just called you ...
Hey , I was just calling you at the office .
I gotta talk to you .
Come on , stick with me . - how long you gonna be in today ?
Depends if the judge calls my client .
See , what does this say about me that I let you treat me like this , huh ?
I 'm giving you a big cashing whoop in the world ... help me man .
My daughter 's about to go to surgery .
I 've heard it all before , val .
You understand ? - come on .
Talk to me .
What do you got ?
Okay , I got something big for you .
This guy 's gonna be the big money to Inglewood .
But the problem is , if he goes up before the judges .
At noon , okay ?
You listening to me ?
I 'm listening .
So , the client , his mother ... his mother comes to the office at 8 am in the morning ...
and ...

Just listen .
Listen , it 's not criminal .
It 's just real estate , okay ?
And I made them so crazy about you ... that they now wanna put up their malibu beach house against a million .
The bail 's a million ? - yeah , yeah ...
What did they book this guy for ? - well , I 'd say it 's romantic .
The cops are saying he beat up the girl really bad , they wanna sell the deadly weapon ...

See , I take care of my friends .
I even take care of you , bubble .
Inglewood by noon .
Go do it , man .

Spread the seeds ...

Is this real ?
Don 't bullshit me , is this real ? - of course it is , why would I lie to you ?
You 're gonna take care of me , right ?
Make them forget the beach house and go for my bond ?
What 's the name ?
Louis .
Louis roulet .
R o u I e t .

Alright , spare the wheel , but , you got it .
Roberto .
[ Mexico language ]
You mind checking that list ?
See if our man uh ... harold casey is on it ?
Oh , don 't go that low ...
I got a case across town at noon .
I gotta get to it .
You mind just bringing him down ?
It 'll just be a sec .
Reynaldo . - pardon me ?
My name 's Reynaldo , not Roberto .
Us bailiffs all look alike , right ?
Your man white ?
Yeah , he 's white .
I got blacks down here right now .
Alright , listen .
Reynaldo .
My bad on your name .
I do a lot of askin ' , I was wrong .
But I didn 't forget you at christmas time , did I ?
Remember that giant nut with the prizes , happy holidays with your friend , Nick ?
I went through those pretty fast .
Alright , let 's make it two this time .
Okay .
I 'll bring your buddy down , but you 'd better make it quick .
Gracias , Reynaldo .
Harold casey .
Yeah , bring him down .
Harold !
Shouldn 't be running from your lawyer .
That 's bad form .
You know what I wanna talk about ?
In a minute , judge powell 's gonna call us down .
He 's gonna wanna know if we 're ready for trial .
We are ?
We are not .
And you know why not .
Rule one , I get paid .
Or i don 't work .
Don 't worry , I got your money .
Exactly , you got it .
I don 't .
It 's coming , I talked to my boys .
Listen , harold , I look down the list of people I trust .
You 're not on it .
The law says you can 't just quit .
The judge won 't let you .
I looked it up .
Pay close attention .
Michael haller for the defense , your honour .
If I may , I 'd like to carry this over .
You have a reason , Mr. Haller ?
Having trouble locating a witness , your honour .
An indispensable witness , Mr. Green ?
How much time do you need ?
That 's hard to say .
Does the state object ?
No , your honour .
Alright , we 'll hold this over .
Pending notification from counsel .
That was some bullshit , man .
Oh yeah .
I expect to hear from you , harold .
Inglewood , earl .
Keep it on the suburb streets .
[ Phone ringing ]
Earl , headphones .
This is haller .
And this is your office .
Uh ... actually , i 'm in my office , ms .
Lorna .
I 'm on my way to inglewood .
Listen , jot down and remind me to give reynaldo ... the bailiff over at san fernando , $200 for christmas , alright ?
Got it .
Hey , did val reach you about his customer ?
Yeah , 'i got something big for you , mick ! '
Everytime .
Any other calls ?
No , just some odds and ends .
Pdui 's , they just recruited some house members .
Oh ... gloria larson called from county lock- up .
She got popped again ?
The usual with complications .
Coccaine possession .
First appearance is right after lunch .
Tell her , i 'll try .
So , i was thinking , boss , you know , uh ... when you get your licence back , why not maybe uh ... you know , like a stay- on .
Like permanent things on me , you know ?
I got my licence back 3 months ago , earl .
Hey , boss .
Want me to do something about that ?
' Cos i can .
Uh ... keep doing what you 're doing .
Boss ?
Alright .
Pull over up here .
Councilor .
Eddie . - how 's it hangin ' ?
Oh , a little to the left , my man .
How about you ?
Not bad .
Your car 's a little messy .
Yeah , maid didn 't come 'til tuesday .
What can i do for you , big man ?
Our boy , harold called from the pens , said you 're stalling his case 'til you see some more 'green ' .
I don 't get paid , i don 't work .
We paid you , $5 , 000 .
That 's long gone , eddie .
Look , i could tell you , the half of it went to an aerial photo expert .
He 's gonna blow the state 's case by showing that the dea violated the air space ... over harold 's farm by flying too low .
I can also tell you that i gotta fly that guy in from new york city ... get him to testify , put him up in a hotel , and all that kind of stuff .
But you don 't need to know that .
All you need to know is that we had a deal .
It 's time to refill the tank .
What ?
Another 5 grand ?
Ten .
He wants to fly business .
He wants first class hotel .
And we want harold back on the farm .
He 's our best farmer , you know what i mean ?
I don 't .
And i don 't want to .
Now , look .
Either pay me .
Or go with the public defender .
He won 't know much about air space , but ...
aren 't you gonna count it ?
I just did .
Keep that rubber on the road , eddie .
Let 's roll , earl .
So , this expert flying from new york .
You want me to pick him up at the airport ?
There 's nobody coming in .
The best camera experts in the world are right here in hollywood .
Nice , you know what ?
You would 've done alright on the streets .
Shit ... what do you think i am , earl ?
Louis roulet ?
Yes .
I 'm michael haller .
Mr. Haller .
Our guy called you because i need someone .
This whole thing is a set- up .
I made a mistake with that woman and she was setting me up ... keep your voice down , hear me ?
Don 't say anything about the case , until i get you out on bail .
I understand your family lawyer 's in court ?
Yes , his name 's cecil dobbs .
He 's here somewhere . - i 'll find him .
Tell me about yourself .
How old are you ?
32 .
Ties to community ?
Did you grow up here ?
Yeah , beverly hills .
Went to usc .
Work for my mother 's business .
What about your father ?
He died when i was 2 .
How much did you make last year , louis ?
The taxes said $600 , 000 .
I want a lawyer too .
My name 's corliss .
Who 's this ?
You got a card on you ?
listen , buddy , they have a lawyer for you out there .
Right now , i need you to back away and give us a little space .
Can you do that , pal ?
I 'm backing , boss .
Here we go .
All good .
There we go .
There we go .
Now , listen , they 've uh ... put some heavy charges on you , louis .
The da 's probably gonna ask for no bail .
No bail ? - i said they 're gonna ask for it .
When was the last time you were arrested ?
Never . - so , if i check your record . ... you 'd find parking tickets .
Are you gonna get me out of here ?
I 'm gonna try , louis .
Are you the prosecutor who used to have the roulet 's case ?
Haller .
Son of a bitch .
Rules are rules .
I wanted this one .
Okay , okay , i 'll go quletly .
But after today 's hearing , if you don 't object ... depends .
You going for no bail ?
That won 't change with the prosecutor .
Not after what your guy did .
If he didn 't ?
Sure 'if ' .
Bailey picked him in her home with blood all over him .
I love it when you get sarcastic .
Can i see the arrest report ?
You get it from whomever takes over .
No favours on this one .
How 's hayley today ?
She 's good .
Good .
I 'll pick her up the usual time on saturday .
Because of the seriousness of the offence ... the financial resources of the accused . ... the state requests no bail .
Your honour , there 's no way the state can claim that my client is a flight risk .
He 's not . - with resources like this man has , flight is always risk .
Are there any priors ? - no , your honour .
Then , i 'm gonna reduce the risk of flight by ordering him to a tracer anklet ... and i 'm gonna set bail at $1 million .
Judge , have you seen the photo ? - ms .
Mcpherson , the bail is set .
Thank you , judge .
Mick , feeling like to thank me and speak good of me ? ' cos this one 's gonna be the money , i 'm telling you .
We 'll see , we 'll see . - this is the lawyer right there , cecil dobbs .
Hey , mick , don 't forget our deal .
... he 's here now .
I 'll talk to you later .
Cecil dobbs . - mr .
Haller .
Depressing to see the boy caught up in that kettle call .
The boy ?
I represent the family for a long time .
Listen , my advice is , let val fix you up the bond .
And you , take the boy home .
Well , we were thinking of putting up property .
There 's the windsors beach house .
Mother 's name is windsor ?
Her second husband 's name .
He 's dead now .
Assessing the house could take days .
Trust me , you don 't want the boy in the clean cleveland that long .
So , tap val .
Take louis to your office ... i 'll meet you there at 4 .
Here , let me give you my business card .
Oh boy .
Media ?
Yeah , that 'll be on us .
Mrs. Windsor 's sensitive about the press .
I guess there 's much we can do about that .
We 'll see .
Say , bob !
Come here .
Come here .
Saw you filming in there .
What 's your name ?
Name 's rob gillan .
They call me 'sticks ' .
Sticks , you freelancing on this ?
Yeah , your client 's got profile , figure i 'll sell to local news .
How much ? - how much what ?
How much they pay you for what you shot in there ?
Uh ... that depends .
7 ... 750 ?
How about we take it off your hands ... for 8 ?
No ?
Too short ?
Alright , let 's make it a grand .
Deal ? - it 's yours .
So , i can expense this , right ? - of course .
Absolutely .
Thank you , sticks .
Thank you .
You know , mr .
Haller ... you weren 't my choice .
Bet i wasn 't .
Firms like yours must have some heavy hitters on call .
We do , but louis insisted .
Frankly , i 've never heard of you .
But uh ... maybe i should have .
Did you say i was louis ' choice ?
Yes , he read about a case you had .
I need a hundred grand upfront .
Working at $550 an hour ... another hundred if we go to trial .
The motion goes pass a week .
Appeals , we start over .
I take it that 's no problem ?
No . - see you at 4 .
Where are we heading now ?
We gotta go and meet sticks at jim 's .
The same spot ? - hm- hm .
Alright .
There he is .
There we go .
Eight for me , two for you .
Thanks , sticks . - anytime .
Hm- hm ... - hey , hey , my tape !
You don 't look good , girl .
Thanks .
Something new ?
Booked on possession of coke ?
Plus the usual .
I know , it 's dumb , it 's ... a guy paid me with it and i had it on me when i went to the next .
And the next was a cop ?
Yeah .
Look , can 't you get me one of those ... .
Rehab places that get you straight ?
We did a pre- child rehab last time .
The da 's never gonna go for it again .
You may have to do some jail time , gloria .
I can 't .
Yes you can .
Yes ... you can .
Hey ... they have programs in jail too .
Look , you 've had a long run .
Maybe after this you 'll get a life .
Yeah .
Housewife of the year .
That 's me .
Maybe i can turn some tricks for the pta .
It 's not funny . - i 'd like to see that .
Alright , alright , give it to me .
Alright , i uh ... i did a guy at the traveller 's at santa monica .
A guy who paid you with coke instead of money ?
Yeah , and he had a show of coke in there , i saw it .
You know him ? - no .
He reached me from my website .
He was uh ... he 's mexican or something .
Did you screen him ?
Oh , i screened them all .
Okay , with what ?
His driver 's licence ?
His passport .
It was uh ... his name uh ... - his name 's hector . - hector what ?
Um ...
what 's his last name ?
Think , gloria , think .
Hector arande moya 's what you get if you run a trace .
He 's a fugitive from a the grand jury down in florida .
The da wants him for drug trafficking .
And leslie , they want him a lot .
And your girl 's looking to trade ?
She gives you his hotel and room number .
She 'll also testify on the coke ? - no , location only .
You guys take it from there .
My best guess is that hector hasn 't checked out yet .
And in exchange ?
You drop all charges , all she does is a pre- child rehab .
The facility at the usc med would be nice .
Or i can take it to the feds .
They 'll cut this deal in a minute .
Alright , you fucking asshole .
After you .
You 'd go head first ? - i 'd give it a shot if i was gonna do it .
Why ? - star points .
You 're so vain , nobody cares if you kill yourself .
It 'll look cool .
What do you think the last thing that 'd go through your mind would be ?
Your asshole .
Mr. Haller .
Louis , good morning .
Thank you . - it 's just a start .
This is frank levin .
Frank 's my investigator .
Louis roulet . - good to meet you .
We 're in here .
Got a ... tracer anklet .
A present from your friend , val valenzuela by the order of the court .
As if i 'd go any place before this thing 's over .
Gentlemen , welcome .
Mr. Dobbs . - mr .
Haller .
Good to see you .
This is frank levin .
Mr. Levin is my investigator .
His fees are in addition to mine .
Of course .
Gentlemen , this is mary windsor .
She 's louis ' mother .
Mr. Haller . - mrs .
Windsor .
Pleasure to meet you . - how do you do ?
Fine , thank you .
This is frank levin , my investigator .
How do you do ?
The charges against my son are ridiculous .
So is that woman .
Here 's a cheque for you , mr .
Haller .
This is going to have to come from your son , mrs .
Windsor .
You can give him the money , he can write the cheque .
But it must come from him .
He 's my client .
And i have to be clear from the start .
I can 't thank you enough for being here .
Sincerely , it 's good to know that you 're gonna be there .
When we need you .
But not now ?
Is that it ?
No , ma 'am .
The da can make you testify about what you hear .
Attorney priviledge does not cover you .
I 'll see you at home .
She 's not used to being told what to do .
I can believe that .
So , how fast can i go to trial ?
I want this behind me .
Are you sure ?
You can stretch it out and enjoy your freedom .
Most clients choose to ...
guilty . ... clients , you mean .
Okay , then i insist on going to trial right away .
Or perhaps , it never goes to trial at all ?
My firm can bring uh ... considerable influence to bear .
Oh , don 't kid yourself , cecil .
There 's no way the state 's dropping these charges .
As a matter of fact , they 've already upped them to the negotiating position .
There won 't be any negotiating .
No plea bargain , no nothing .
I 'm not going to jail for something i didn 't do .
I 'm innocent .
And if there is a trial , i wanna take the stand and tell the jury ... that i 'm innocent .
Now , if that 's a problem , we can part company right now .
Time to tell me what happened .
I was having a drink at the association .
The association ?
The bar on 6th street ?
The one with a lot of young women ?
Right .
Good for pick- ups .
What 's the file say about the girl , frank ?
Uh ... regina campo .
Known as reggie , 26 years old .
Part time actress , part time office temp .
And hoping to retire after suing my client .
Did you know her before last night , louis ?
No .
I 've seen her around , but ... we never spoke .
She was always with another guy .
Last night too .
I got it that she wasn 't into her date .
She brushed by me on her way to the bathroom .
She basically just laid her address on me , on a napkin .
She said she could get rid of him by 10 .
Do you still have it ?
What she wrote down ?
No , i didn 't keep the napkin .
Check the file .
See if the police report has any of this .
Frank here has already worked us a little miracle .
He uh ... happened to score us a copy of the discovery file .
Everything the da has .
They would have had to turn it over eventually , but it would 've taken a while .
No , they don 't have the other guy .
They don 't even have the bar .
So , what ?
All they 've got is louis shows up at her apartment ... and she gets beaten ?
That is such bullshit .
Just keep telling me your story .
Okay .
I got there early .
And uh , waited until he came out .
Did you see what he was driving ?
A blue mustang .
Alright , so he comes out , you go in ?
She saw it was me .
And opened the door .
Uh ... the hallway was tight .
So i had to ... walk pass her , you know ... she closed the door .
So my back was to her and um ... that was it .
What was it ? - she hit me with something .
I got down ... and verything got black fast .
Show me where she hit you .
Right here .
Still hurts .
And that blow knocked you out ?
Next i know , 2 faggots were sitting on me .
Holding me down .
Police report has it , it 's the a homosexual couple from across the hall .
Like i said , faggots .
I stand corrected .
Faggot couple from across the hall .
Go on , louis .
I was still foggy when the cops came .
My name 's officer maxwell , i 'd like to ask you a few questions .
Can you tell me your name , please ? - reggie campo .
Do you know this gentleman ?
You met him before ?
No !
That 's when i saw she 'd set me up .
Set it up , how ? - she put blood on my hand .
My left hand .
He said he was gonna rape me .
And kill me .
And then he said he was gonna come back here and rape me again .
You said she left her door open a crack .
Did you happen to see her face ?
Not all of it .
Mainly her eye .
Wait , her left eye ?
Yes . - alright , so she already had the injuries to the right side of her face ... she opens the door ... conceals that from him .
And as he enters , she ... she clobbers him .
So , our case is what ?
She beat herself up ?
If she already had the injuries ... she either did just that or she had a boyfriend do it .
She must have .
I mean , she saw louis ' maserati ... his watch .
It 's known the family has money .
I weigh you should be filing in civil court the moment this is over .
Let 's hear the police report .
How 's reggie telling ?
Okay , according to the victim ... she was home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door ... as someone she knew .
Upon letting him in , she was immediately struck .
Does it say , he knocked her down ?
Yes , there was a struggle that continued from the hallway to the stairs .
He held the victim by the neck ... and forced her down .
Suspect maintained the position ... behind her ... holding a knife against the left side of her throat .
That 's not my knife .
His prints all here , frank ?
Well , stands to reason , if she put blood on his hand ... she put his prints on the knife .
I just told you though , that isn 't my knife .
Keep talking frank .
As ms .
Campo ran for the stairs ... they fought and she kept the intruder backwards .
Realising her attacker had her cornered she fought free and ... reached a nearby bottle of vodka .
And that 's when she clogged him .
That 's her story .
Those are all lies .
Look , if everything she 's saying is a lie ... then , this is going to be the easiest case , ever .
But you swear , it 's all lies ?
All of it ?
Are you sure there 's not anything ... that you 're not telling me ?
Nothing .
Why did he choose you , mick ?
Rich kid , spoiled as shit ... never heard the word 'no ' ... yeah , but the damn thing is , the way he tells his story , frank .
Just quite enough to be true .
I don 't know , mick .
This kid feels wrong to me .
But , i 'll check out his story .
All of it .
Start at the association bar .
And then , this regina campo .
The way he said she came on to her ... sounds like a pro .
Yeah , write it down .
Also uh ... mr ... . mr . mustang ?
Alright , i still don 't get how that works .
What ?
He and reggie got into some rough train then he punched her ?
Unless he was in on it .
Meaning ... he hit her afterwards ?
Bingo .
Jesus , mick , are you starting to think louis is innocent ?
He just might .
Besides , you know , my father always said about an innocent client .
No , i 've never heard this .
Hi ... he said 'there 's no client as scary as an innocent man ' .
That 's right .
' Cos if you screw up and he goes to prison ... you 're never gonna be able to live with yourself .
So , there 's only one verdict you can put on the board , baby ... and that 's an n g .
What do you say , mags ?
Frank , if you let a man drive home in this condition ... i think that i can charge you both .
I 'll take him to his house .
How are you gonna get home ?
Earl could pick up the car from me in the morning .
I came with friends .
Later .
No , no , i got this .
I insist .
What ?
Moonlight becomes you .
You do not do me any good , haller .
Hey , mick !
Jesus , frank .
What couldn 't wait ?
Wanna watch a movie ?
We caught a break .
The owner had a camera system set up last month .
I had the ... security tape transferred to a disk .
So i could manipulate ... i know this place .
There 's our boy , louis .
And i would like you to meet ... ms .
Reggie campo .
And there 's ... mr .
Mustang .
Are you sure ? - i wouldn 't have popped a grand for the tape if i wasn 't sure .
Now , watch .
Reggie gets up , goes to the ladies room ... mr .
Mustang chats up the bartender .
So that 's where he goes ... and give reggie her chance ... watch her .
Wait , that 's not how he said it went down .
He said she gave him her address on a napkin .
Okay , hold on , hoss ... hold on ...
let her go pee .
Okay , here she comes .
There 's your napkin .
Now , watch this .
She and mr .
Mustang decided it 's time to split ...
look , look ... look at his hand .
Look at his watch .
So he 's left handed .
That 's my bet .
Facial blows are from the left .
This guy 's right handed .
Mick , you haven 't been drinking enough .
You said you knew the association ?
You would realise , this shot is into the mirror behind the bar .
' Cos that 's where the owner set up the camera so he could watch his register !
Things are backwards . - and mr .
Mustang punches with his left .
Yeah ... you proud of yourself , frank ?
I really really am .
But not just about this .
That feeling i had about reggie ?
That she was selling it ?
I did a little bit of research ... she 's our girl .
You tell me the cops don 't have this ?
How can they ?
There 's only one and it 's not a copy .
Then make a copy .
What ?
You 're gonna give it to the prosecutor ?
Yeah , a new guy named , ted minton .
He 's gonna hand over the discovery file .
Oh , poor bunny .
He 's not gonna know what hit him .
How long 'til you think your man 's back ?
Probably just a few more minutes .
Mr. Haller .
There he is . - sorry to keep you waiting .
The discovery file . - i hope this will be worth your while .
Kinda light .
You have a place where we can play this ?
What else do you have ?
What else do i have ?
Come on , minton .
Let 's cut the bullshit here .
Alright ?
Not only your so- called victim a prostitute ... but i have her soliciting my guy on video .
You think the jury 's gonna see this ... and think he had to rape her at knife point just to have sex with her ?
No .
Are you listening to what i 'm saying ?
Yes and it doesn 't change the offer i 'm prepared to make .
Offer ?
You going forward ?
We will drop down to assault with the deadly .
Attempted sexual battery .
Guidelines put that on ... 7 years , maybe he 'll do 4 ?
What am i missing here ?
Hey , frank !
What 's up ?
Alright , look here .
These files look identical to me .
Alright , there 's something we 're missing and we 're not seeing it .
Well , here 's the discovery file i got from my clerk in da 's office .
And this is the one i got from minton .
Wow ... wow ... wow ... here we go .
Here we go .
Here we go .
Son of a bitch .
They switched up the files .
This is a different knife .
Hm- hm ... - i 've been taking care of this guy for 10 years .
And he set me up .
Well , he 's off the christmas list .
He 's on the shit list .
Good shot !
Looks a little short to me .
You guys finish yourselves .
See you later .
They 've closed down anyway . - alright .
Louis .
So , what happened ?
Did you see minton ?
Oh , i saw him .
We need to talk .
You lied to me , louis .
You didn 't tell me you were paying reggie campo for sex .
I don 't go lookin ' surprised .
Could 've easily told me that in cecil 's office .
I don 't want my mother to find out .
Cecil tells her everything .
Oh , so you decided to keep from me the one thing ... that could 've made this trial go away ?
Huh ? - is that what minton said ?
No more trial ? - i said 'could have ' .
If that had been the only lie you told me .
What do you mean ?
Recognise that ?
It 's a picture of your knife .
The one you had on you when you went to reggie 's .
The one the cops have .
That 's why ted minton didn 't focus to answer shit , why should he ?
When he 's got a knife with her blood and your initial ?
That wasn 't the knife that was in the file .
That 's right , it wasn 't .
The file frank got is what we call a 'ioaded deck ' .
The cops use it to set us up .
To make us think they didn 't have anything .
When in fact , they 've got enough to put your golf playing ass for 20 years , big boy .
Why did you lie to me about the knife ?
Louis , why would you lie about anything ?
Everything you tell me is confidential .
Attorney client priviledges .
Alright , i didn 't lie .
I said the knife in the picture wasn 't mine .
I said it twice and nobody listened to me .
What are you now ?
The god damn lawyer ?
You said it wasn 't yours ... what you should 've said was 'i had a knife , mick ' .
' But this isn 't it ' .
You brought a weapon to a meeting with a prostitute .
So , you tell me , how the hell am i supposed to make that look like she set you up ?
I ... did not do this .
It 's custom made .
It 's a razor tip .
It 's got your initials engraved ... on the handle .
I always carry it .
We show homes to people we don 't know !
There 's one time ... my mother was showing a place .
It was in bel air , so she thought it was okay to go alone .
He was there . - who was there ?
The man who raped her .
When she didn 't come back ... i went to the house and found her .
That 's when she stopped showing property .
And i started carrying a knife .
Always .
Your mother will have to testify . - no , no , i don 't want that .
I don 't give a damn what you want .
You wanna stay out of this shit house , you do exactly as i tell you ... from now on , you got it ?
Hey ...
hey ... success .
We had fun .
Got her ? - yeah .
At least you did one thing right , huh ?
We did a couple .
Good night .
Well , look who 's come calling .
Detective kurlen .
Hey , you been to san quentin , lately ?
See our boy , martinez ?
I asked you something .
How 's martinez doing up there ?
He made the pucker- up and kiss me team ?
I haven 't talked to him .
Right , i guess once they plead guilty and go down , you don 't have much use for 'em , huh ?
But uh ... he 's away forever , right ?
He got life , yeah .
So , he 'll be out in 15 .
Too bad , 'cos his victim , donna renteria , she 's dead forever .
How does someone like you sleep at night ?
With all the scum you represent ?
Hey , kurlen .
Come here a second .
I had a client once .
He uh ... decapitated his ex wife .
Kept her head in the refrigerator . - nice , sweet .
The da got greedy .
Tried to pile on 2 unassault murders ... .
Tricked up the evidence , tried to make it look like my guy did it .
But you got your boy off .
And he 's out walking around now , right ?
Well , fuck you , haller . - no , fuck the da .
And the cops who helped him .
It 's called the justice system , kurlen .
It 's not the way it 's supposed to work .
Well , look who 's here ?
Kids ... maggie . - hey ... you like a beer ?
A cold beer .
Scotty !
Oh , we could share this .
No , i 'm good .
Alright , alright .
We swapped spits before .
Tell me about your uh ... your buddy , minton .
Who says he 's my buddy ?
Well , he was saying that you were good .
With that guy , corliss , right ?
Yeah .
How did you know ?
You 'll take the guy 's head off first down .
Hope so .
So what uh ... ted talked to you about corliss ?
No , no , i sent him to ted .
He thought i was on the case because i 'm his first appearance .
But i should not be telling you any of this .
No , i knew .
I knew a guy like minton wouldn 't have bothered putting ajailhouse snitch on the stand .
I mean , that 's what he is , right ?
Can we just have a friendly beer and not talk about work ?
Let 's grab a table up back and grab something to eat .
We can talk about our daughter ?
Okay .
Yeah .
I bet she didn 't know 3d movies could be so much fun .
I was watching her .
Filling the cup . - right .
Yeah .
Hey , you didn 't know minton had corliss 'til i blabbed , did you ?
I knew he was on at something .
Screw it , i 'm not gonna defend minton .
He fights too dirty .
Is this from maggie mcpherson ? - hey . ... you know there are lines i won 't cross .
Don 't you ?
Can you give me a lift ?
{ whispering ] she 's gonna wake up and she 's gonna see us here .
{ whispering ] it 's not fair .
How did she get in here ?
She comes in when she has nightmares .
How often does she have nightmares ?
Don 't start .
You don 't know what it 's like to raise a child alone .
I 'll leave .
Come back in an hour ... we 'll go together to pick up your car ... .
Then , i can take hayley to school .
Just like that ?
You 're gonna start taking her to school ?
Do you remember what we talked about last night ?
Yes , i remember what we talked about last night .
But i thought you were just trying to get my head into your case or get me in bed .
Can 't live with you , can i ?
No , you can 't .
Not when you 're being a defense lawyer .
Not when i 'm trying to keep dirt bags off the streets .
And you keep putting them there .
Heard it all before , mag ! - hm- hm .
Donna renteria .
Oh , man , they have my picture everywhere , man .
They 're gonna bring me in anyway , so i 'm fucked .
Thought you told kurlen you were in her apartment ?
He didn 't have that .
No , no ...
he didn 't have it .
He didn 't even have any prints .
No , but that 's just ... it was true ... .
I saw her at the arizona ... i was uh . ... she said , if i paid her more money than the other guy ... then we can go to her place .
Nobody saw any other guy .
There was another guy !
It was ... it was uh ... a white guy .
He was right by the bar .
The coroner says her vagina was brutalised .
Are you my lawyer , man ?
I 'm trying to be .
look , when i left , that chick was fine .
Look , i slept with her , okay .
I did , but i didn 't hurt her .
I promise .
Three people saw you throw a knife into the la river .
Huh ?
Help me . - i had that knife in my car .
I knew they were gonna find it , man .
They were gonna pin it on me .
I know !
look , if all you did was have sex with her ... then why didn 't you leave any prints , huh ?
I mean the place was wiped down clean .
I didn 't wipe it down , though !
You left semen on the towel ?
You remember that ?
Did you forget the towel ?
No !
I didn 't forget anything man !
I ust used that towel , i paid her and i left .
That defense ain 't gonna make .
Dude , don 't say that ! - it won 't make , man .
There 's not a chance in hell with that defense .
You know what they 're asking for ? - what ?
They want the death penalty , man .
They wanna take your ass down .
They wanna burn you , man .
Listen .
I can see to it that that never ... happened .
But not if you don 't plead .
Oh , you want me to say i did it ?
There 's a deal to be made here .
And i can do it .
I can get you life .
Now , life means you 're paroled in 15 .
It keeps the needle out of your arm , man .
It 's our only play , man .
This parole ... you know what it means ?
That means i didn 't do it !
That 's the best i can get for you , man .
I don 't wanna go to jail for something i didn 't do , man .
You know what 's that 's gonna do to my mom , bro ?
I ain 't going to jail for something i didn 't do , bro !
Come on , man .
Please help me , bro .
Please help me .
California state prison san quentin
i 'm not gonna ask how you are , 'cos i know .
No , bro .
You don 't know .
But i need to ask you some questions , jesus .
Oh , questions ?
Now ?
You know what ?
You didn 't ask me a lot of questions back then .
You never asked me . 'did you kill her ? '
No .
Please , i 'm trying to make this right .
I need you to tell me what happened at the arizona bar that night , one more time .
Please .
She was workin ' .
I liked her .
I mean , out of them , i liked her .
She was the one .
You know , she caught my eye .
They were going around in a little circle , you know .
She was acting all cute and shit .
I don 't know how this turns out , you know ... no , it 's fine .
You wanna dance ?
Yeah , i wanna dance .
I can give you a private dance .
I picked her .
I asked her to dance for me .
# And we started talking . #
# you know , she said that i could take her home . # so , how much for me to come over ?
Well , usually i charge a thousand .
But for you ... $300 , 'cos you 're sexy .
# And she was good , man , yeah . #
# so i did . # but i ain 't kill her .
You said there was another guy , right ?
Yeah .
She was talking to him .
And then she came back to me .
Okay .
I got some pictures , alright ?
Some mug shots .
Jesus , see if you can id ... that other guy at the club .
Tell me if you recognise him .
No .
How about this guy , jesus ?
Recognise him ?
Uh- uh .
Okay , take your time .
Yeah , yeah .
This guy ?
Is this the other guy ?
Is this guy in the club that night ?
Guard !
Jesus . - having fun ?
Is this the other guy ? - why you play me , bro ?
Why are you bothering me with this anymore ?
Jesus , is this the guy ? - what does it matter , man ?
I 'm right here .
Right where you wanted me , bro !
Is this the guy ?
This is the guy ?
You know what ?
I don 't trust you , bro !
Jesus , i 'm trying to make it right !
It never will ! - interview 's over .
Okay , that 's my boy , that 's my boy ... .
Get out of here , yeah !
Hey !
You okay ?
Where 've you been today ?
Been trying to call you .
I 've been to san quentin .
To see jesus martinez .
About what happened after ... he left donna renteria 's apartment .
After he killed her ? - he didn 't kill her , frank .
He went there .
He had sex .
Flushed the condom down the toilet .
Wiped his his print on a pink towel and he went off .
But he didn 't kill her .
Come on , mick , we 've been through this a hundred times .
# The real killer ... #
# she let him in . #
# maybe uh ... he faked like he was martinez 's friend and acted like he had an appointment . #
# like the guy in the bar ? #
# right .
He comes in .
He punches her . # # she 's not gonna be like like reggie campo . #
# cos this time , the bitch pulls a knife . #
# takes her and puts her on the table .
Puts on a condom and rapes her . #
# and when he 's done ... #
# she was stabbed ... over and over ... #
# 52 times like he was something of his god damn mind . # do i have to tell you what kind of knife it was ?
A short blade folding knife ?
Just like roulet 's .
Okay , okay , let 's take it a little bit easier on that , okay ?
Why , frank ?
Why didn 't i listen ?
Listen , i got a baseball bat if you really wanna beat yourself up .
I don 't wanna beat myself up .
Son of a bitch told me he didn 't do it .
Alright ?
There was the dna .
And there was the knife that ditched .
But there was no way i was gonna listen to him .
There was no way i would believe that he didn 't do it .
I couldn 't believe him !
I couldn 't believe , that i actually ... .
Could represent an innocent man .
Just like my father warned me about .
Mick , come on , they all said they didn 't do it .
You know that . - so , what did i do ?
I get him to plead .
I get his sister to beg him to plead .
' Cos he got no case .
So i gave him the best deal i can .
You know , i feel pretty god damn good about it .
' Cos hey , i got the son of a bitch off death row .
I got him 15 years instead of the needle .
Yeah .
I showed him roulet 's picture .
Okay .
Roulet is using martinez as the other guy in the bar ?
Like mr .
Mustang in this case ?
So , he 's not just getting off and killing women .
It 's seeing somebody else do the time .
That 's his mo .
What did martinez say ?
Enough .
Enough for me to know .
I gotta ... i gotta find ... what you gotta do , is find a way to put roulet in renteria 's apartment the night she was murdered .
That 's what you gotta do . - i have to find a way to make it right , frank .
I gotta make it right .
Well , you can 't bring him to the cops 'cos he 's your client .
And you can 't take him to the da 'cos you 'll lose your licence .
Worse , any evidence we found would be inadmissible ... attorney client priviledge .
It 'll ruin any case that we could ever have against him .
That 's why the son of a bitch hired me .
He 's got me in his trick bag .
You got one client in jail for what your other client did .
What are you gonna do , mick ?
Hey , mick , you okay , buddy ? - frank , frank , listen to me .
I got it .
What ? - you know how roulet said all we 'll find on him is parking tickets , right ?
Right . - i just don 't buy that anymore .
Now , there are others .
Other girls he did .
Renteria and campo , i mean , they look too much alike .
Like their sisters .
And the injury to the right side of their face is too similar .
Right ?
This guy 's got a type , frank .
There are other cases out there .
And you can find them .
Now , you gotta do this , i can 't .
I 'm his lawyer . - okay , okay , i 'm on it .
Alright .
I gotta take this .
Maggie , hey . - hey , did you get my voicemail ?
Uh , i 've been up at san quentin to see an old client .
How 's hayley ?
# She 's good .
She 's got soccer this weekend . # saturday , right ?
Hm- hm . - i look forward to it .
# Great .
Talk later . #
if you 're wondering how i got in ... i 'm in real estate , so , if i wanna get into a friend 's house ... no , we 're not friends .
You 're my client .
I 'm your lawyer .
My lawyer .
See , that 's exactly what i wanted to remind you of .
I 'm about to go on trial .
And yet ... i couldn 't reach you .
Now i found out where you were all day .
Heard you tell maggie .
You shit . - you went to see jesus martinez .
And i know what you talked about .
Donna renteria .
You 're right , mick .
I killed her .
There .
No reason why i shouldn 't tell my own lawyer .
Since it 's all confidential .
Attorney client priviledge .
Isn 't that what you told me ?
It 's time for you to go , louis .
Alright .
That 's a cute picture of your daughter , hayley .
She 's very pretty .
She 's got soccer practice tomorrow , right ?
Don 't .
Don 't what ?
You think you 're the first client to ever threaten me with my family ?
Huh ?
All i said was she 's pretty .
Are you scared , louis ?
Because where you are , right now ...
you 're in a very dangerous place .
# So , in conclusion ... # # what this case is about ... #
# what this case is all about ... # # is a predator . # on the night of march 6th ...
louis roulet was out stalking his prey .
Now , you 're going to hear from the victim herself , about her lifestyle ... .
One that we would not condone .
But remember .
Anyone .
Anyone .
Can be a victim of a violent crime .
This case is clear .
It 's straight forward .
A man attacked a woman in her home .
In order to rape and kill her .
And it is only by the grace of god .
That she 's here to tell her story .
Ladies and gentlemen .
My name is michael haller .
And i 'm representing louis roulet .
Now , mr .
Minton ... doesn 't wanna use the word prostitute ... .
For the woman who was supposed to be louis ' victim .
He needn 't worry .
Because this case isn 't about how she makes her money .
This case is about her actions .
How she saw a man with signs of wealth . ... as a ticket out of the life she was in .
And chose to target him .
Now , what she didn 't count on , was you .
How you put two and two together ... and let your common sense tell you ... who the real predator is , in this case .
Thank you for your time .
The court will adjourn until monday .
And the state will call its first witness .
Go , hayley , go !
Turn , turn , turn !
Left foot !
Left foot !
Hey , mick .
Hey , maggie .
What are you doing here ?
I 'm gonna take hayley home .
You 've got some place to be .
What are you talking about ?
What happened ?
Hey , hey , sir , stop .
That 's my family .
Sir ! - family .
This is a closed crime scene . - sorry , name 's mick haller .
Sobel , sobel ! - yeah , yeah , yeah ... .
Listen , slow down a second .
Slow down . - what happened ?
Somebody shot him .
In the chest and the head .
And they shot the dog too .
His body is right in front of the door .
Great , this is just what we need .
So you 've uh ... been here before .
You can tell us if anything is unusual .
Anything weird ?
Like , throughout this whole house ... why is it that all i see are pictures of this guy ?
My partner 's asking if frank levin was gay ?
Is that relevant ? - yeah , it 's all relevant .
He 's an ex cop .
Cops against persons in chicago .
Is that botch enough for you , lankford ?
I don 't see anything that i can help you here .
Alright , hey , haller .
I don 't need to tell you to stick around town , where i can find you , do i ?
Am i a suspect ?
When do you retire , lankford ?
When do i retire ? - yeah .
18 months , why ?
I make sure i show the next one so i can kick your ass .
Val !
Hey , mick !
The hell you banging on the door like that for , man ?
Are you nuts ?
Dude , dude , you look terrible .
Frank levin was murdered .
Oh man , i 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry to hear that . - roulet did it .
Roulet ?
I thought you and frank were defending him ?
Why would he take frank out ?
That makes no sense .
You know , val .
I figure you know exactly how it went down .
How would i know about it ?
What are you talking about ?
' Cos you lied to me .
You didn 't send me the roulet case .
He asked for me . - okay , okay , that 's true , man .
But you know what i said ? ' haller 's your man , go for haller ' .
I did that for you .
You lied to me once .
So what ?
Do you think i would lie about this ?
Give me a little respect , give me a little credit .
I 'm not gonna lie about this kind of shit .
The police checked the tracer that you put on roulet .
It says he was no way near frank 's house .
So maybe it wasn 't him , mick .
Maybe it wasn 't him .
Nobody can beat the tracer , huh ?
It was him .
Roulet killed frank .
It was roulet . - i don 't like the way you 're following me ... i don 't like the way you corner me , man .
I don 't like the way you 're talking to me , okay ?
Roulet killed frank , val .
What do you think ?
You think i cut the kid loose , so he could murder frank ?
Crazy roulet killed frank !
Mick , i 'm sorry about frank , but i didn 't do it , man .
You 're the only one that could 've taken it off him .
Being married to you sucked .
But being your car service ...
maggie .
Yeah ? - you know what i used to be afraid of , maggie ?
Yeah ... me .
That i wouldn 't recognise the innocents .
That they 'll be right there in front of me , but i just wouldn 't see it .
Yeah .
You know , when i talked to minton ... guilty or not guilty , just as innocent , you know ?
You know what i 'm afraid of now ?
Evil .
Pure evil .
Maggie ... did i get frank levin killed ?
Micky , no .
# New message , yesterday , 11 : 07 am . #
# mick , it 's me , i tried you on your cell ... #
# sorry to interrupt your date with hayley , but ... #
# you asked me to do some digging ?
On roulet ? #
# well , i might have found martinez 's ticket , micky . #
# his ticket out of quentin . #
# uh ... someone 's at the door .
Look , you go and you have a good time with hayley . #
# and i 'll fill you in when i know it 's for sure . #
# i gotta go . #
[ phone ringing ]
Detective sobel . - sobel , mick haller here .
Listen , i just checked my messages .
It turns out , frank called me just before he was killed .
The message came in at 11 : 07 .
He said he found something .
Something that could help an old client of ours get out of prison .
# Okay , who 's the client ? #
# jesus martinez .
He 's in san quentin . # okay , did he say anything else ?
Yeah , he made ajoke .
Uh ... he said something about finding martinez 's ticket out of the queue .
And then someone came to the door .
That 's when he hung up .
Listen , whoever came to the door ... that 's your killer .
Okay , you got me a copy of the tape .
# Yeah , i 'll give it to you right away . # how is it going with the case ?
You getting somewhere ?
Yeah , uh ... we did catch a break .
We found a bullet casing in the room from a .
22 .
That 's good , frank levin owned a .
22 .
You 'll find one registered to him .
# Yeah , we did , but uh ... #
it wasn 't a muslin . - a what ?
A colt woodsman .
It 's an old antique job .
# That 's the gun that killed him . #
morning , mick .
It 's too bad about frank levin .
Got any idea who did it ?
Yeah , i 'm pretty certain i do .
Mr. Talbot .
You were with ms .
Campo on the night of march 6th .
Yupe .
We went on a date to the association .
Then i took her back to her place .
For another date .
And , did you have sexual relations ?
About four hundred bucks worth .
And she earned every single cent .
What time did you leave her apartment ?
Oh , i don 't know uh ... about 5 minutes before 10 ?
Did she say whether she had another appointment ?
Oh , no , no , she acted like she was done for the night .
Objection , your honour .
I don 't think mr .
Talbot 's qualified to interpret ms .
Campo 's thinking or plans .
I mean , she acted satisfied .
Sustained .
Go on , mr .
Minton .
When you left , mr .
Talbot .
What condition was she in ?
Was she hurt ?
No , she was fine .
She did not look like this ?
Man .
What kind of sick bastard that did something like that ?
Answer the question .
No .
No , we made pleasurable and consensual love .
I mean that 's what life 's all about , right ?
Mr. Talbot , are you a right handed ?
Or left handed ?
Left .
Left ? - yeah .
Isn 't it true that before you left ms .
Campo 's apartment ... she asked you to repeatedly strike her in the face with your left fist ?
Your honour , mr .
Haller 's just muddying the water without rigid statements .
It 's part of the defense theory , your honour .
The witness can answer .
I 'm sorry .
Can you repeat the question ?
This is by your hand , isn 't it , mr .
Talbot ?
Admit it , this whole thing is a set- up .
By you and ms .
Campo .
Framing my client , louis roulet , isn 't it ?
I never hit her .
Or any other woman , you understand ?
You know a prostitute named shaquille barton ?
Working name is uh ... shaquilla shackles ?
Yeah , yeah , i seen her once .
And if i brought her in here , can she say 'yes , mr .
Talbot , he did strike me ' ?
With his left fist , in my face ? - she 'd be lying .
I tried shaquilla once .
I 'm not into that rough stuff .
I 'm a missionary man .
It 's a strong left .
Am i on trial here ?
Not yet .
Good afternoon , detectives .
What can i do for you ?
This warrant is bullshit .
Well , it 's good enough to search your house .
It would 've been smart if you 'd told me that you had a woodsman ?
There 's one registered to you .
Let 's go for a drive .
Alright .
Let 's bag the box .
Can 't do ballistics on a box , can you ?
Modern technology .
So uh , why didn 't you report this stolen ?
I don 't know .
Maybe i should have .
You think ?
Still and all , we 're gonna have a look around the place , huh ?
Go crazy .
You got the warrant .
Alright , start with the couch .
Sir ?
Stand up .
Hey , you know , we got a history on the piece .
Turns out , it once belonged to micky cowen ?
The gangster from the '40s ?
I know .
My father , he uh ... represented him .
Got him off for using it for self defence , so ... micky made him the present of it .
Nice present .
Pearl handle , collectors ' piece .
How sweet .
You know , that uh ... that micky cowen shooting ... it 's ... it 's pretty famous .
It turns out that the county , still has the evidence on storage .
The bullet . - you can match the casing from a slug that 's 50 years old ?
It would be easier with the gun , but ...
Yeah .
How long will ballistics take ?
Hey , mick .
I got something for you .
You asked me to find out that witness ' name .
Is it corliss ?
Dwayne geoffrey corliss .
Right .
He 's a low life type .
Not much came up .
But , sometimes he goes by dj .
With punctuation ?
And when you read it that way ... tell me .
Well , he 's played the courtroom snitch a lot .
Here and in arizona .
Both times , they got him early release .
Alright , this could be good .
All i gotta do is find him .
They put him on a pre- child rehab at usc .
I just got lucky .
There she is .
How are you , sweety ?
You alright ?
Alright , listen .
I 'm actually not in here about you .
I need you to do something for me .
Keep moving !
Let 's go , let 's go !
Stay on the wall , all the way down !
That 's the bucks , boys , let 's go .
Stay on the line .
Corliss , right ?
I only came to say what is required .
Rusky !
Ready for the line !
You don 't know me .
You talk to the da ... he can get a way to get both of us out .
Step through !
So , haller , you had an interesting visitor last night .
Worry about yourself , ted .
You 're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don 't even know it .
Class witness , your honour .
The prosecution calls regina campo .
It 's true that i uh ...
lied to the police .
I knew the defendant when he came to the door .
Ms. Campo ... why did you lie ?
Because i 'm scared .
I didn 't think the police would believe me ... and i wanted to make sure they arrested him .
' Cos he 's an animal .
Do you regret your decision now ? - yes .
If it helps him get free and do this to somebody else .
That 's prejudiciary , your honour .
Sustained .
I have no further questions for ms .
Campo .
Your witness , mr .
Haller .
Ms. Campo .
Have you engaged to an attorney ?
To sue ... louis roulet for the events that happened on the eve of march 6th ?
No , i haven 't .
Have you talked to an attorney ?
I haven 't hired anyone .
No , have you talked to one ?
About a possible lawsuit ?
It was nothing more than talk .
Did you ask him if you could sue him for damages ?
I thought what you say to lawyers is private ?
If you wish , you can tell the jurors .
I think i 'd like to keep it private .
Let 's talk about the night at the association bar .
Have you ever seen louis roulet before that night ?
Yes , there and other places .
Ever noticed that he wore a rolex watch ?
No .
Or that he drove one of 2 vehicles ?
A maserati and a range rover ?
I never saw him driving .
And what made you approach him ?
I saw him leave with girls uh ... who do what i do .
With prostitutes ?
Then go to a hotel or one of their apartments , right ?
I don 't know where .
Well , how do you know they left ?
Maybe they just went out for a smoke ?
Because , i saw them getting in his car . ...
and drive away . - no , wait a minute .
You just testified that you had never seen mr .
Roulet drive .
Now you 're saying , yes , you did see mr .
Roulet get in his car and leave with a prostitute like yourself ?
Which one is it ?
I saw him get in his car , but i didn 't know what kind of car it was .
You know the difference between a maserati and a range rover ?
One is small , one is big , i guess .
Okay .
The other women .
Had left with louis .
When you saw them again ... did any of them ever have injuries or any of them beaten ?
I don 't know , i didn 't ask .
But girls in your profession , you do talk to each other ... about customers , right ?
You warned each other ... if someone 's a freak or something ?
Yeah , usually .
And did any of them ever warned you or have one bad thing to say about louis roulet ?
No .
No one .
So you believed you 'd be safe ?
I thought he was a known quantity and i needed the money , so ... so you thought , he could solve your problems with money ?
No ! - no ?
Isn 't that why you 're sitting here ?
Because you zeroed in on him .
No !
I mean , yes , but it wasn 't like that .
He attacked me .
I swear .
And ... alright , let 's pause that right there .
Just to confirm ... this is you ?
Right , ms .
Campo ?
Yes .
What was on the napkin ?
My name and address .
And your price ?
Yes , $400 .
It 's a hard line of work .
Yes , and dangerous .
In fact , haven 't you told your friends many times ... that you were looking for a way out ?
I 'm not proud of what i do .
I know .
And isn 't it true ... and nothing will be easier to understand ... that you saw louis roulet and his money as that way out ?
No !
That 's not what this is about !
Are you not listening to me ?
No further questions , your honour .
Mr. Minton .
Do you have another witness for us ?
Minton looks worried .
Not worried enough .
No .
The state rests , your honour .
Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch .
Yes , i recognise this knife .
It 's the one that my son has carried with him for protection .
For the last 4 years , almost exactly .
Why would he need protection ?
Realtors alone in the house are sometimes robbed or ... hurt ?
Even raped or murdered .
Has louis ever been subject to such crime ?
Oh no .
But he knew someone who was .
Raped and robbed by a man .
Louis found her .
It was terrible .
So , the first thing he did afterwards , was getting himself a knife .
To carry it with him at all times .
Thank you , ms .
Windsor .
I have no further questions , your honour .
Your witness , mr .
Minton .
Ms. Windsor .
You seemed pretty exact about when it was your son started carrying around this ... this weapon .
A five inch folding knife . - yes , i am .
The incident took place on june 9th , 2007 .
Was it in the newspapers ?
Do you somehow remember it because ... the police came to talk to louis ?
No , there was no police investigation .
Then , how do you remember the exact date ?
Were you given it before your testimony here today ?
I remember the date because ... i 'll never forget the date i was attacked .
And louis won 't forget it either .
He found me in the house tied up .
My clothes were ripped .
It was traumatic for him .
Mr. Minton ?
Is there anything else you wish to ask ?
No , your honour .
I 've been thinking about those thousand razors ?
We 've hads an offer .
You spend 6 months in the county jail .
Like i told you from the beginning .
No deals , no bargaining , i 'm innocent .
Save it .
You make the call .
I don 't give a shit .
You got my answer . - yes , i do .
I 'll pass it along .
You do that .
Oh , louis .
Tomorrow ... i 'm putting you on the stand .
I 'm ready .
Oh , you 'd better be .
Hey , earl .
There 's something , i need you to get for me .
Your honour , the defense calls louis ross roulet .
I knocked uh ... she looked through her side window ... and saw that it was me .
And opened the door .
Then , i walked pass her towards the living room .
What happened next ?
Something hit me from behind .
I blacked out .
I have no idea for how long .
Is that all ? - when i woke up , uh ... .
Two guys were sitting on me ?
Telling me not to move .
I couldn 't anyway .
I was ... i was scared .
But you had blood on your sweater .
And on your left hand .
Someone put it there because i didn 't .
You didn 't strike ms .
Campo with your left fist ?
No .
Threatened to rape her ? - no ...
threatened to kill her ? - no !
I am not that guy !
I ... do you have any idea what it 's like ... to be accused of something like this ?
To sit there ... and listen to people tell lies ?
About you ?
About you having done something this sick and depraved ?
Call you an animal ?
Talk about your sex life , humiliate you ?
Listen , i understand the process .
I know i had to sit there ... and better be qulet .
And wait my chance .
But if guilty people have rights , what about innocent people ?
I am innocent .
I 'm innocent and i want this behind me .
I have no further questions , your honour .
According to you ... ms .
Campo ... punched ... herself ?
Or she had ... someone she had never met .
Violently and visciously beat her as a part of a set up ?
All i know is i didn 't .
This knife that you always carry ... how did she know she 'd find it on you as part of the set up ?
Guess she couldn 't .
Could she ?
I never take it out .
I never show it to anyone ... so , she must have just found it in my pocket after ... she or whoever knocked me out .
Isn 't that right ? - i would prefer if i ask the questions .
Okay .
Mr. Roulet , i 'd like you to take uh ... .
Take a look at this photo .
Tell me again .
Do you think , regina campo would or could ... have done this to herself ?
I don 't know who did it .
But it wasn 't me .
Nobody deserves that to happen .
What do you mean by 'deserves ' ?
Do you mean ... crimes of violence ... only comes down to a woman getting what she deserves ?
I mean , no matter what she does ... or who she is .
No woman deserves that .
I have nothing further , your honour .
Mr. Roulet , you 're excused .
Thank you .
The defense rests , your honour .
Before deciding to rest this case , the state would like to take the night , your honour .
For what purpose ?
To consider a rebuttal witness .
What witness is he talking about ?
I have no idea .
The court will adjourn ' til 10 o 'clock tomorrow .
Morning , bill . - morning .
I 'm gonna go grab some coffee .
You want some ?
No , man , i 'm off caffeine .
Right , is that the custody list ?
Yeah .
let me see if i any of my clients are on there .
Sure .
Corliss , dwayne .
Lorna , minton 's putting corliss on .
He 's already in lock- up . - but that is great !
Yeah , it 's good .
How did it go with you ?
You served kurlen ?
Yes , i did . - okay .
I 'm going back to court now .
Stand by .
Okay .
Hey , haller , what is this bullshit ?
I have nothing to do with this case ?
Subpoena to appear as a witness .
You 'll just have to wait and see .
It 's a legal document , detective .
Hey .
Glad you made it .
Is he looking romantic . - ever so specially .
See you later .
Mr. Minton .
Does the state have any rebuttal ?
The state intends to call dwayne geoffrey corliss , as a rebuttal witness , your honour .
Judge , who is this witness ?
And why wasn 't i told about him until now ?
Bailiff ?
Remove the jury .
A fair question .
Mr. Minton ?
Dwayne corliss is a co- operating witness who spoke with mr .
Roulet in custody .
Following arrest . - that 's a lie !
I didn 't speak to anyone !
Qulet , mr .
Roulet !
Mr. Haller , control your client .
Let me take it from here .
Judge , i share my client 's outrage .
How long has the state been sitting on this testimony ?
Mr. Corliss just came forward yesterday , your honour .
Yesterday ?
This is incredible .
Do you want to go back and talk to him ?
Give him the time ?
I 'd allow it .
No , you know , thank you , though , judge .
I think we all know what this is .
Mr. Minton 's putting ajailhouse snitch on the stand .
Everything he says will be a lie .
That 's groundless , your honour . - i want my objection noted .
Then , i 'm going to rule .
He can testify .
Call the jury in .
May i ask one indulgence , your honour ?
May i step into the hallway and ... make a call to an investigator for whatever good it may do at this late date ?
Thank you , your honour .
Yupe , i 'm here .
Come into the court house at exactly 10 : 15 with the printouts .
Mr. Corliss .
Are you incarcerated at this time ?
Um ... no , now , i 'm just in the courtroom .
But you are currently being held in a jail ward at usc hospital , correct ?
Yeah , since i got arrested .
For burglary and drug possession ?
That 's right .
Now ... do you know the defendant ?
Yeah .
I met him in lock- up .
We 've had a stopover from jail .
Then we were together in the tank when we came for first appearances .
Talk at that time ?
Yeah .
Talk about how bad are the cigarettes .
Anything else ?
Uh ... you know ... what are you in for ?
Like that .
And ... did he say what he was in for ?
He said , for giving a bitch exactly what she deserved .
Those were his words .
For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved .
Now ... have i or anyone else promised you anything in exchange for your testimony today ?
No .
Just the right thing to do .
Thank you , your honour .
How many times , have you been arrested , mr .
Corliss ?
About 7 times in l .
A.
Couple more in phoenix .
And new york , if you wanna count those .
Yeah , so you know how the system works , yeah ?
I tried to survive .
Does that sometimes mean ratting out fellow inmates ?
Your honour , i object .
Take a seat , mr .
Minton .
I gave you leeway for bringing this witness in .
Thank you , your honour .
But i 'll rephrase .
What i 'm asking you , is how many times have you snitched ... on a fellow inmate ?
This makes me four . - this makes your fourth time ?
Four times you 've testified ?
For the prosecution ?
Against a fellow inmate ?
Makes you a popular man , mr .
Corliss .
Sounds like people just come up to you . ... and they tell you the crimes they 've committed ... so you can come in here and testify against them .
People talk to me .
I 'm a friendly guy .
You 're a friendly guy ?
Can you say you and my client were friends ?
Louis roulet ?
So he just said to you ... what you just told us and told the jury that ... that he gave a woman what she deserved ?
And then the two of you are back to talking about cigarettes ?
Not exactly .
It 's like he was braggin ' .
Told me he did it before .
He said the other time , he killed the bitch .
Got away with it then .
Can get away with it now .
Mr. Haller ?
I have no more questions , your honour .
Redirect , your honour .
What the hell is this ? - you tell me .
What the hell did you say to this guy , huh ?
Nothing .
This is a set- up .
And you 're doing this . - how ?
How am i doing this ?
Huh ?
You said he was bragging .
How ? - well ...
like he told me the details .
Of the other one .
That he killed .
She was a ... dancer ... at some club .
And she had ... sexy snake tattoo wrapped around her body .
Did he say anything else ?
Hm ... no .
No .
Snake girl stuff was it .
How does he know this , louis ?
You think i know ? - if you didn 't tell him that shit , somebody did .
Better start thinking about who that could be .
Then i have no further questions , your honour .
Any re- crossing from the defense ?
A moment with my staff , your honour .
Be quick .
Is it all here ?
Yeah . - okay , good .
Listen , you go on now , leave the building .
I don 't want anyone asking you questions , got it ?
Okay . - alright .
Dwayne .
Mind if i call you that ?
Sure , man .
Wow on the assistant .
You 're a funny guy , dj .
Dj .
Isn 't that what they call you uh ... for example , down in phoenix ?
Maybe .
And my assistant , one whose numbers you want ... she was reading on a uh ... on the internet about a dj corliss .
Arrested in 1989 on drug charges , hometown imesa , arizona ?
Oh yeah , that 'd be me .
So you remember fred bentley , right ?
Uh ... your honour ... where 's the defense going with this ?
Make a connection soon , mr .
Haller .
But the witness will answer .
I don 't remember any bentley . - sure you do .
You testified that he confessed to you . ... the crime that he was charged with .
Raping a 10 year old girl .
But he denied it in court .
Are they ringing any bells ?
Dj ?
1989 , i was high a lot .
I don 't much recall ... i would like you to read this for us .
Your honour , this is a news report from the arizona star 1997 .
8 years after mr .
Bentley was convicted .
I ask that you admit it into evidence .
Your honour .
A news report ?
Let 's see where it takes us .
Let 's take it objectively . - thank you , your honour .
If you could read this for us .
Mr. Corliss ... i 've highlighted the part i 'd like you to read .
I 'm not good at reading . - that 's okay .
You take your time , we 'll make it through it .
A man , frederick bentley ... wrongly convicted of rape was released saturday after ... conclusive dna results cleared him of the crime .
The case was bolstered at trial by a testimony from an informant ... dj corliss in may 7th , who had claimed bentley bribed him about the rape ...
altogether in a holding cell ...
that 's enough .
Thank you .
Mr. Corliss .
Were you charged with perjury ... in this incident , dj ?
No , i was not .
Is that because the prosecution was complicit to your confession ?
Judge ! - were you promised the same thing here , mr .
Corliss ?
To say that louis roulet bribed you to lie now ...
alright , mr .
Haller , alright , mr .
Haller , let it go !
Sorry , your honour .
I have no more questions .
I 'm excusing the jury for an early lunch .
Bailiff , see them out .
Mr. Minton .
Do you know what you have done ?
You put a documented liar on the stand .
A man with a record of putting innocent people in prison !
Your honour ...
shut the hell up , when i 'm talking to you .
I can think of nothing ... more prejucicial or corrupt ... than what i just saw out there .
Do you realise , what you have done to my trial ?
He 's gonna talk to his boss .
To decide what they wanna do when the judge comes out for directive verdict .
What 's a directive verdict ?
It 's when the judge takes the case from the jury 's hands .
Clears acquittal .
Oh my god .
It 's no more than a few minutes .
I wanna know , how corliss got that shit he 's saying .
Maybe frank levin told him .
Maybe he found something , he gave it to corliss .
And that 's why you killed him .
Court 's back in session .
Your honour , i spoke with the district attorney .
The state wishes to dismiss all charges .
You have the motion in front of you .
This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice .
Case closed .
Yes , your honour .
Mr. Roulet , you 're free to go .
Court 's adjourned .
Mr. Haller .
Thank you so much for my son .
You 're welcome . - you were splendid .
Thank you .
I want the gun .
Of course you do .
I wanna talk .
Mr. Haller .
I insist you join us for dinner tonight .
For a celebration . - i don 't think so .
Louis roulet .
You 're under arrest .
What do you think you 're doing ?
Hands behind your back . - what 's the charge ?
He 's under arrest for the murder of donna renteria .
Everything that man said was a lie !
You have the right to remain silent .
You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning .
If you give up that right , anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law .
Do you understand your rights as i 've read them to you ?
Hey !
Look at me .
Do you understand your rights ?
Detective , can i have a word with him ?
Well , that 's it , louis .
I got you off .
Time to find yourself a new lawyer .
I 've still got your gun .
And you 're gonna have to explain how you got it .
Thank you , detective .
Come on , louis .
Mary ...
not a word .
You get my kid out ofjail .
Haller ... you are one messed up son of a bitch .
First you get your client off .
For assault .
Only to burn him for murder .
You don 't have enough to charge him for the renteria murder , do you ?
Yeah , we got enough to screw with him .
There 's no way the da was letting roulet walk out of here ... not after what just happened .
I don 't get you , haller .
Whose side are you on , anyway ?
God damn it .
Earl !
Dude ... hey , i 'm sorry boss .
I stepped away for half a minute , alright ?
Alright , alright , alright .
Just take the ticket out of my pay , alright ?
You don 't make enough .
This one 's on me .
Let 's roll . - alright .
Alright , let 's go to the house , earl .
Hey , boss . - hm- hm ?
You know you had a favour you asked me ?
The guy i know , he picked it up on the street .
Real clean .
Hey , boss .
Be careful , alright ?
Yes , sir !
Mick , it 's me .
I tried you on your cell ... sorry to interrupt your date with hayley , but ... you asked me to dig on roulet ?
Remember ?
You said you didn 't buy it ?
That all he had was parking tickets ?
Well , i might have found martinez 's maggie , i got it .
I think i know why frank levin got killed .
Yeah ? - alright , call lankford , have him pull up roulet 's driving record .
Every ticket he ever got .
That 's what frank did .
He said he found martinez 's ticket out of the q ... i just never knew what he meant .
Okay , done , but i have to tell you something .
They let roulet go .
Hm- hm ... they didn 't have enough to hold him .
You 're right .
I guess it 's best i got involved .
Maggie , is hayley with you ?
She 's at my sister 's , why ?
Go to your sister 's .
Stay with hayley .
And wait for my call .
You got it ?
Okay .
Val , it 's mick haller .
Oh , hey mick .
I haven 't heard from you since you busted into my office ... and accused me of conspiracy to commit murder , huh ?
You know , if i have any self respect , i 'd hang up on you right now .
Wait , wait , frank died , alright ?
I was out of my head .
I need you to do me a favour . - oh , you need a favour ?
You know , you got more balls than a chinese ping pong tournament , okay ?
I can 't do that . - alright , listen , you can kick my ass later , alright ?
It 's important .
Is roulet still weearing the tracer ?
Yeah , yeah , yeah , he is .
I gotta call him he 's coming in the morning to get it off .
Guess you kicked him , huh ? - yeah , i need you to track him for me .
Oh , i can 't , i can 't , i got little betty coming in a few minutes .
Val , val , stop whatever you 're doing .
I need it , man .
I need you to do it now .
It 's about my family .
Yeah ?
It 's me .
He 's heading out north on san fernando .
Mick , mick , i think he 's headed for your house .
You want me to call the cops for you ?
Bullshit . - i 'm telling you , he 's just passed down the stadium .
No , no , no .
He 's not going to my house , val .
Oh , hey , hey , hey ... you 're right , you 're right .
He 's just drove passed your street .
He 's not headed for your house .
I know where he 's going .
Hello ?
You 're welcome .
Not , it 's alright , don 't worry about it .
Hello , Louis .
My family 's here .
I know .
Bring your knife ?
And my gun ?
Maybe .
Good .
' Cos I brought this .
You got one chance to turn around and Ieave .
And then what ?
You gonna keep coming back every night ?
Everyday ?
Or , just try to get me sent up to San Quentin , Iike Jesus Martinez ?
No .
I 'm not quitting untiI Martinez is free and you 're convicted of murder .
And when that needle goes in your arm . . .
That wiII be me .
WeIl , why don 't you just shoot me right now ?
I don 't think I 'II have to .
Hey !
That 's my car !
What are you doing ?
It 's Louis ' car , man !
Come on , now .
Get him up .
Get up !
Hospital , not the morgue .
Hey , Mags .
You were right , Mick .
Roulet got a ticket outside of Renteria 's apartment on the night that she was murdered .
It 's aII gonna be on the DA 's desk in the morning .
Where are you ?
Just about home .
So , what do you say , I come pick up you and Hayley . . .
At your sister 's place in an hour . . .

Great .
Yeah .

[ Mick singing ]
Breaking and entering , huh ?
Just Iike your son .
You knew , Mr. HaIler .
You need to get the heII out of my house , Ms. Windsor .
You knew .
You set him up .
The only person that was set up here . . .
Was me .
And how did that turn out for you ?
You have no idea who we are .
I know that your son , Louis is going down for the murder of Donna Renteria .
I also know that I 'm gonna burn his ass for kiIling my friend , Frank Levin .
He didn 't kiII him .
Yes , he did .
He beat the tracer , and he kiIled him .
Look , I 'm not gonna talk about it with you .
And for the Iast time . . .
Get the heII out of my house .
You 're not Iistening to me .
No , you 're not Iistening to me .
Ms. Windsor , get the heII out of my house .
I told you , my son didn 't kiII Frank Levin .
I did .
911 , what 's your emergency ?
I thought I told you to be careful ?
Hey boss !
Feeling alright ?
Yeah , Earl .
Solid .
I heard down at the court house .
Martinez is out , is that right ?
Yes , he did .
Do you think he wiII pay for what he did ?
Nothing is free .
Hey , boss , we got some company .
PuIlover here .
What you say , Eddie ?
Did you gather your team ?
You really shot the client 's mother ?
Right .
She shoot me first .
Well , my boys , Harold ...
He had a difficult case - How a file ?
He needs your helps , Counsellor .
Ok .
Call me the details . ...
I have to say that the situation goes on like this .
We have deserved a discount !
I tell you what .
How about I do this one for free ?
On this episode of
Take a look at my abraham lincoln etching .
Autographed at the bottom .
That 's incredible .
But first hint on anything this age is ,
Why do we have black ink there ?
Right .
And I 'm not saying this is fake .
I 'm just saying it could be .
I have a badge from the old series .
This was one of the very first police shows .
There are no more of those badges anywhere . - \ xB6 dum- de- dum- dum , dum \ xB6
[ laughs ]
It 's a parade cannon
Used by civil war soldiers .
I really want to hear this thing go boom .
It produces a substantial report .
So it 's loud .
Extremely loud .
I 'm rick harrison , and this is my pawn shop .
I work here with my old man and my son , big hoss .
Everything in here has a story and a price .
One thing I 've learned after 21 years ,
You never know what is gonna come through that door .
Hey , how 's it going ?
Hi .
Very good .
What do we have today ?
I have a badge from the old series . - \ xB6 dum- de- dum- dum , dum \ xB6
[ laughs ]
I came to the pawn shop today
To try to sell my vintage badge .
I 'd like to sell it today because it stays in a drawer .
I 'm hoping I can get $500 for it .
I really don 't want to sell it
If I can 't get at least $350 .
So how did you get it ?
Just the facts .
Just the facts , ma 'am .
Okay .
[ laughs ]
I was eight years old .
My uncle worked on the show as a member of the crew .
I believe it was given out
As a lapel pin for people to wear .
And he gave it to me .
Okay .
I loved it when I was a kid
Because to a kid , it seemed so real .
It did . - " the names have been changed
To protect the innocent , " you know .
This was , like , one of the very first police shows .
was groundbreaking .
It started off on the radio in the 1940s
And was on and off tv until the early '70s .
It was based on real - life police cases ,
And it set standards still used on cop shows today .
You know if they gave out full- size badges
Or anything else like that ?
Never heard of it .
Can 't find any .
Can 't find this one .
There are none of these in existence
Except the one you 're looking at .
That 's pretty amazing .
The other cool thing is , it actually looks
Like it 's made by a badge company .
There 's a few big badge manufacturers
In the United States ,
And I think they probably went to one of them
To have this made .
A lot of old tv shows had stuff you could send away for ,
But this is way different .
It was only given to staff members ,
So it 's much more rare .
I 've never seen one before ,
And I 'm thinking collectors of tv memorabilia
Will definitely be interested .
What 'd you want for it ?
I 'd like to get $500 .
$500 is not gonna happen .
I 'll go 300 .
Could we do 400 ?
If you had a large one ,
There probably wouldn 't be a problem .
They didn 't make that in a large size .
I know , but the problem is , really small things like this
Are a much tougher sell because they 're harder to display .
I 'll go $350 .
There are no more of those badges anywhere .
What do you think , chum ?
I mean , there 's probably not as many fans
As there was 20 years ago .
$350 for it .
That 's the best I can do .
We got a deal .
All right . $350 .
All right , you want to write it up , chum ?
Sure .
Let 's go right over here .
Okay .
This badge is cool .
But I think chum got it right .
The market for memorabilia
Is only gonna get softer .
What is this ?
I think it 's a mandolin .
I 've never seen one like this before .
That 's metal , corey .
Yeah , it 's metal .
Looks like it 's been run over by a truck .
[ air horn blasts ]
I decided to come to the pawn shop today
To sell my old mandolin .
It 's very beat up .
I 'm not sure if it 's worth anything ,
But I have no need for it ,
So I 'm gonna try to see how much I can get for it .
Where 'd you get it ?
I actually found it in a basement
Of an old home back in new jersey .
I 've seen wooden mandolins .
I 've never seen a metal one .
You ever hear of national ?
Not really .
Mandolins are used largely in country western , cajun music .
Mandolins was used in europe back in the 1700s ,
And they were a big deal in america
When bluegrass music got popular .
When I found this in the basement ,
You know , I figured it had some value
Because I know a lot of people collect these older instruments .
I 'm just worried about the condition of it .
I mean , it 's all there .
It just , I think , needs to be a little restored .
Yeah .
All the key things has been replaced
With little bits of wood .
Needs a lot of tender lovin ' care .
So what are you looking to do with it , man ?
Pawn it , sell it ?
I 'd like to sell it .
You got a price in mind
Of what you 're looking to get for it ?
Um , you know ,
I have no idea what it 's worth .
That makes two of us .
Let me get somebody down here to give us a price for it .
That 'd be great .
I can 't say for sure
This mandolin is actually worth anything ,
But it 's different enough
To have somebody come take a look at it .
From time to time , I get a call from this guy
Who collects cannons .
We 've never made a deal , but he just called me again
And promised me I would love this one .
So corey , chum , and I are gonna go meet him
Out at the gun range .
So what do we got here ?
It 's an antique parade , or saluting , cannon .
I 'd like to shoot a potato out of it .
[ chuckles ]
I called the guys at the pawn shop today
To come down and see my antique parade cannon .
This cannon , I actually keep it in my house ,
But it is a little bit on the large side .
I 've done a lot of research ,
And I 'm pretty sure it 's worth $60, 000 .
Can you tell me anything about it ?
This is obviously a breech- loading cannon .
You insert a cartridge in it that 's preloaded with powder .
And it was used by the civil war soldiers after the war
At a g . A. R. Post .
Do you know what that is ?
Yeah , the grand army of the republic .
This was their cannon that they used in memorial parades
To salute the civil war soldiers ,
And it produces a very nice , substantial report .
So it 's loud .
Extremely loud .
The grand army of the republic was a veterans group
That started right after the civil war .
They were just a social group when they started ,
But they grew into one of the most powerful organizations
For veterans .
So where did you get this thing ?
I bought it from a museum that was deacquisitioning some items .
Okay .
Did they have any paperwork or anything else
When you bought it ?
Eh , not really , to tell you the truth .
Is the carriage original , and the caisson ?
Everything is all original .
This is an amazing old cannon .
You rarely see one of these in private hands ,
And collectors go crazy for 'em ,
But I hate that he 's got no paperwork for it .
You have to be really careful about stuff like this .
So why did you want to sell this thing ?
My neighbors are getting pissed .
Okay .
[ chuckles ]
Let me call up a buddy of mine .
Let me get him down here , have him take a look at it .
If everything 's legit , maybe we can do something .
I really want to hear this thing go boom .
Oh , you 'll love it .
All right .
Let 's do it .
Let me go give my buddy a call .
He 's bringing an expert .
Well , that 's good .
Maybe he can alleviate his concern ,
And he can pay .
Is this thing even worth anything ?
Yeah , it is , especially with the hawaiian motif
That 's on this one .
But sounds like there might be something loose in it .
Yeah , it looks like it 's been rode hard and put up wet .
Yeah .
I want to make sure , if I buy this thing ,
The feds aren 't gonna be running through my door
And throwin ' me in cuffs .
I need to look at certain aspects of this .
This is an issue .
You ever ran this thing past the atf ?
Not really , to tell you the truth .
Hey , how can I help you ?
Hi , um ...
I was wondering if you wanted to take a look
At my abraham lincoln etching here .
That 's not an etching .
That 's a print .
Okay , my abraham lincoln print .
Okay .
I thought abe was bald .
Why would you think that abe lincoln was bald ? - 'cause he always wears that top hat .
It 's a stovepipe hat ,
And he wasn 't bald .
Ooh , excuse me .
[ sighs ]
okay .
Come to the pawn shop today to see if I could sell
My abraham lincoln print .
The reason I want to sell it today
Is , I 've had it for so long
And not really done anything with it .
I don 't really know how much it 's worth ,
But with it being abraham lincoln ,
There 's a chance that it could be worth a lot of money ,
And that would be pretty exciting .
So you have a print here of abraham lincoln
That 's autographed at the bottom , " a .
Lincoln . "
We have oxidation around the edges of the paper here ,
So you can tell that it 's pretty old .
Mm- hmm .
Lincoln died in 1865 .
Right .
People have been putting up pictures of lincoln
For over 100 years .
Everyone points to him as an example
Of what a president should be .
I mean , the guy helped end slavery
And guided us through a civil war .
He 's earned a place of respect in history .
You got something really interesting here .
In 1865 , they still used lamp black , iron filings .
It was a weird combination for ink , okay ?
After 60 , 70 , 80 years ,
Those iron filings began to rust .
Okay .
That 's why , when you look
At old documents and things like that ,
All the letters are no longer black .
They 're orange .
Okay .
That 's interesting .
First hint on anything this age is ,
Why do we have black ink ?
Right .
Right .
All right ?
You every hear of joseph cosey ?
No .
He could forge just about anything .
Joseph cosey was one of the most famous forgers
In american history .
Cosey faked everyone from benjamin franklin
To george washington
And sold them to big - time collectors .
He even forged a copy
Of the declaration of independence .
This is something that was done ,
I believe , 1920s , 1930s .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
He did a great abraham lincoln signature .
Okay , I mean , it was identical ,
Except for , for some reason ,
He always lined up the " a " with the " lincoln . "
Abraham lincoln 's " a " was always below the " l . "
This is lined up perfectly .
Okay .
So if you ever see the " a " lined up with the " lincoln , "
It 's joseph cosey .
So , I mean -- it worth anything ?
Believe it or not ,
The forgeries by cosey are worth a little bit of money .
Really ?
Because it was by a famous forger .
But ...
What you have here is a copy of a forgery .
And I know that because one of my guys actually bought
One of these a few years ago , and I had it checked out .
So is it worth anything at all ?
Nope .
Yeah , [ bleep ] .
I mean , 'cause you don 't even have the forgery .
Right .
You mean this is a copy of a copy ?
It 's a copy of a forgery .
It 's not even the real forgery .
[ laughter ]
All right .
Thanks for bringing it in , man .
Thank you .
Appreciate it .
Unfortunately , he wasn 't able to make me an offer ,
But I think it 's gonna be a real interesting conversation piece
From this point on .
Earlier , a guy brought in a mandolin
That looks like it 's made completely out of metal .
It 's a new one to me , so I called my buddy jesse down
To come take a look at it and see what he thinks .
What is this ?
Oh .
Well , it 's obviously a mandolin .
And , uh ...
It 's in pretty rough shape .
It looks like it 's been rode hard and put up wet .
Yeah .
I work at a vintage guitar store here in las vegas
Called cowtown guitars .
Every time the guys get any kind of weird instrument in ,
They give me a call , and I try to help them out .
So why 'd they make it out of metal , man ?
They made 'em out of metal
So they could put this cone inside of here
And make it louder than the acoustic instruments
So it could be heard over horns
And all that stuff in a big band .
It 's probably one of the last metal body resonators
That you see from the '40s because of the war effort .
They stopped making them out of metal .
And before there were amplifiers ,
They tried this resonator technology
That they used in these to make them loud enough .
It 's pretty rad .
This one is probably a late '30s , early '40s .
They were actually a pretty popular instrument .
Had a pick guard on it .
It was probably tortoiseshell , and it 's long- gone .
It 's really , really tarnished , but ... [ strums chords ]
the cone is still intact .
And the little piece of wood here
Called the biscuit ,
Which makes it resonate off the cone ,
That 's all still there .
I mean , is this thing even worth anything ?
Believe it or not , yeah , it is ,
Especially with the hawaiian motif that 's on this one .
It 's a style .
I didn 't even know there was any motif on it .
Yeah .
[ laughs ]
In this condition , this one , I would say ,
Is worth about ...
About 1, 000 bucks .
Wow .
That 's -- that 's great .
Are you sure , man ?
This thing looks beat .
It 's a vintage national .
I mean , that is the company to have .
Would it be worth having it restored ?
Yeah , you know .
If it was in really good shape ,
You 'd probably pull close to $3, 000 out of it , easy .
Wow .
Thanks for coming down .
No problem .
Appreciate it .
Any time , guys .
It looked like it had been through a war
And left at the bottom of a swamp ,
But because of what it is ,
And it actually being complete and still working ,
It was actually still worth some money .
And you heard jesse say
I 'm gonna have to put some work into it .
I 'd like to offer you around $300 for it , man .
Um , I mean , he did say it 's worth $1, 000 .
He did say it 's worth $1, 000 .
I 'm gonna put it on my shelf , I 'm gonna ask $999 for it ,
And I 'm gonna let someone
Beat me all the way down to $800 .
Would you do $500 ?
You wanna do $500 ?
Yeah , go ahead .
Let 's do it .
All right , man .
Let 's go do some paperwork real quick .
Okay .
Very good .
Thank you .
I still can 't believe this thing
Is actually worth 1, 000 bucks ,
But I guess I 'll just have to wait and see
Till it 's actually restored .
Earlier , I checked out an antique parade cannon
That looks awesome ,
But there 's no paperwork .
So I asked my buddy sean to come out
And see what he could tell me about it .
Hey , sean .
What 's goin ' on , buddy ?
Today rick called me out to the middle of nowhere .
And this thing be better worth it ,
Because this was a long drive .
Holy , shh ... [ bleep ] .
How you doing ?
Check out this badass cannon .
Yeah .
So what research have you done about this ?
Well , the first owner would have been the g . A. R. Post
And the sons of veterans .
They had it built for them for the parades .
Civil war veterans , they would want to have g . A. R. Conventions ,
Grand army of the republic ,
And all the veterans would gather with their families ,
And they would fire one of these big cannons
Out of respect for their fallen soldiers .
And you 've fired it ?
Yeah , I have fired it .
I really want to hear this thing go boom .
Let 's burn some powder .
[ laughter ]
Awesome .
Let 's go .
Let 's load this thing up .
Your cannon , your honors .
All right .
I 'm gonna put the cartridge on .
Okay .
Screw off this collar ,
Put it around the cartridge ,
And then screw it onto the breach ,
And that also acts as a shell extractor
When you want to remove it from the cannon .
There .
It goes in like that .
And it will lock in position .
And you need that lanyard .
Stick it on here .
And it 's ready to go
When you pull the lanyard .
Then she 's gonna let loose .
Guys , make sure your earpieces are in ,
And it wouldn 't even hurt to put your hands over your ears
On top of that when this thing goes .
All right , you guys , need to get back .
Okay .
Three , two , one .
Fire !
Me , corey , chum , and sean are out at the gun range ,
Checking out an antique parade cannon ,
And as part of the inspection , we 're actually gonna fire it ,
And if all goes well , I 'm gonna try and buy it .
Three , two , one .
Fire !
[ cannon booms ]
[ laughter and applause ] ]
That was awesome .
Yeah !
Sweet .
That boom knocked my glasses off my head .
I felt a shock wave hit me .
It was amazing .
The guy was right .
Now that I 've seen it fire , I 'm hooked .
It 'll look amazing in my showroom ...
If I can make it fit .
My big concern is , is it legal to own this thing ?
Absolutely .
You definitely have to know what you 're buying .
I can buy any cannon made 1898 and back ,
And there 's no federal paperwork .
An antique firearm ,
The government doesn 't care about them
' cause no one 's going to war with these things .
But 1899 and forward , there can be some problems .
I want to make sure , if I buy this thing ,
The feds aren 't gonna be , you know ,
Running through my door and throwing me in cuffs .
Absolutely .
All right , so I need to look at certain aspects of this
To determine , hopefully , when that barrel was made .
So what research have you done about the plaque ?
You know , all it says is " rickett 's battery "
And the camp number , 40 .
Okay .
Down at the bottom , it looks like " s- e- p- t , "
For the abbreviation of the September .
I see a curl down here with a " 3 . "
And it 's actually ...
" 1903 . "
I can 't buy any guns made after 1898 ,
So this looks like a total bust .
September of 1903 , this was dedicated ,
But ...
Just the pure fact that this was applied to this barrel
Doesn 't tell me without a shadow of a doubt
That this was made in 1903 .
The overall form of this might be 1890s .
This is where it becomes a real gray area
When it comes to the law ,
That this is okay in nevada .
All right ,
So it 's something I would definitely love to buy ,
But until I know everything for sure ,
I can 't even make an offer .
Okay .
I would love to buy this cannon ,
But unless he can track down some documentation
Proving when it was made ,
There 's no way I can touch it .
Earlier , I dropped off a steel mandolin
With my buddy jesse so he could polish it up .
He called to let me know that he 's all done ,
And he 's even gonna drop it off at the shop .
What we got ?
Oh , man , that looks awesome .
Done .
Yeah , you can actually play it now .
This mandolin had to be restored .
When I got it , it was in pretty rough shape
And really rusted and tarnished .
It 's impossible to sell a stringed instrument
When you can 't play it .
Put a lot of work into it .
It 's actually a really well- playing instrument
And sounds really good .
God , it doesn 't even look like the same thing .
It 's just beautiful .
It came out pretty good .
It came out nice .
So what all did you do to it , man ?
Well , we had to clean it up .
You remember , it was really tarnished .
You could hardly even tell that it was chrome or shiny at all .
So we cleaned it and polished it .
We had to replace the pick guard .
Tracked down a real piece of italian lucite ,
Which was really nice .
We had to put new tuning buttons on the original machines .
We had to clean the headstock up .
We had to clean the frets , restring it , obviously .
We got it all playing .
Yeah , it came out nice .
It 's got the motif on the back too .
Yeah , you can actually see it now .
Yeah , you can see it now .
You couldn 't see it before .
Yeah .
You know , you can tell that somebody
Had left strings on it for a long time .
The biggest thing you can do is loosen the strings .
As the wood takes in moisture and lets out moisture ,
The guitar moves , and if the strings don 't ,
It tends to break things , crack things ,
And stuff like that .
Hey , rick !
Come here and look at this , son .
Jesse outdid hisself .
Oh , that is nice .
The key thing now is , you can actually play it ,
Which makes it to where you can actually sell it .
Okay .
Yeah .
Can you play it ?
Well , I can give it a whirl .
[ laughter ]
Give it a shot , jesse .
[ bright string music ]
\ xB6 \ xB6
That 's about as -- [ applause ]
That 's about all my mandolin playing you get .
All right .
Mandolin sounds good .
Now put a price tag on it ,
And let 's sell it while we 're still young .
I paid 500 bucks for it .
What 'd it cost me to get it fixed ?
You know , 150 bucks to get it cleaned up and strung up
And everything .
Cool , so I got $650 in it .
What do you think it 's worth ?
You can probably get two , a little over two probably . - $2, 000 ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
Okay , sweet .
Yeah .
Jesse , we really appreciate it .
Thanks a lot .
Have a good day .
Rick , you 're not the only one
That makes money around this joint .
Just most of it .
[ laughs ]
Hetty has resigned her position .
Who are you ?
Lauren Hunter .
Her replacement .
Zulu- November .
Operation Comescu .
You are not longer on this case , Agent Callen .
Operation Comescu is all about you .
Find her , Agent Hunter , before they all get killed .
Hetty 's alive .
Where ?
for the head of the Comescu family .
I am the head of the Comescu family .
Callen died three weeks ago .
And why should I trust you ?
They are coming ?
Let them come .
Original air date on September 20 , 2011 == sync , corrected by == â™ª
The best fruit .
Handpicked .
I learned this from my mother .
She learned it from her mother .
And her mother from hers .
And so on .
A family tradition then -- preservation .
Some things are more important to protect than others .
Yes , they are .
This feud -- how long has it been going on ?
Since the war .
Now ... it 's over .
Is it ?
I need to know you 're gonna be okay .
I said , I need to know you 're gonna be okay .
Yeah .
I 'm all right .
Because if you 're not gonna be okay , and you 're gonna lose it when you 're supposed to be watching my back ,
I 'd like to know .
That 's the Black Sea .
Yes , it is .
I always assumed it was the Pacific .
California .
You do know where we are .
Romania .
We need to get off the street , figure out a plan .
Couple blocks back , there are some workshops , old warehouses .
Auto trade mostly .
Preferably an alleyway , in case we need to get out fast .
Workshop , warehouses and alleys .
Got it .
How do you know this place ?
I was born here .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
What are you doing ?
Coffee , black .
Sugar , brown .
Brewed , not stewed , and Oreos ... if you want 'em .
No food or beverages in ops .
Who says ?
Doesn 't seem right .
She 's not here , Eric .
No , she 's not .
She resigned .
Yes , she did .
She 's somewhere in Eastern Europe .
Most likely .
She has zero control over what you do , what you say , or what rules you choose to break .
And yet ...
Did you say Oreos ?
No credit card usage .
No hotels booked under her alias .
No contact .
Nothing since that taxi dropped Hetty off at the address in Prague .
It 's owned by a Comescu family company .
Let 's see .
It 's a residential area .
Probably a safe house , or maybe a courier drop , but nothing that makes it stand out --
Whoa .
What ?
It 's a wire report out of Prague .
There was a shooting at that address overnight .
It 's being reported as a gangland war .
Five dead .
All of them Romanian .
One was a Comescu .
I just got off the phone with Interpol .
Said it was more like a military black op than a gangland shootout .
When ?
Just after 10 : 00 , local time .
Six hours after Callen and the others landed in Prague .
Officially , we only have one agent in that part of the world .
Of course , Director , and that 's obviously what you came to tell us .
Director ?
That one agent -- would that be
Agent Hunter ?
Agent Hunter is making enquires about a former employee .
Which would be Hetty .
Miss Lange , yes .
Hmm .
Uh ... any news from Agent Hunter ?
If you find anything , let me know .
So , uh , judging by the dust ,
I think we got a good 30 years before anybody comes back .
We got to find out what we 're up against .
The Comescus probably heard about the shooting in Prague , but we got here fast .
They 'll be expecting us , but not yet .
Well , what if Hetty 's already gone ?
What if they 've already moved her from the beach house ?
She 's here .
They haven 't moved her .
You want to share ?
This is where they live .
It 's where they feel safe .
Go play tourist .
Count heads , map out the perimeter .
Back in 30 .
You got it .
You got 30 minutes .
To do what ?
To tell me what just happened on the beach .
So ... you are
Roma .
Gypsy .
I was born after the war , in a refugee camp in Bucharest .
And your parents ?
Two years ... in a German death camp .
My father died two months before I was born .
My mother ... two days after .
A family in the camp raised me .
They were also Roma .
And what was this family 's name ?
Pavlenco .
You lie .
I most certainly do not lie , Alexa .
Taken yesterday at Prague airport .
You lie , Henrietta .
You lie .
You lie .
You lie .
You killed two of our people in Prague .
And these killed five more .
One of them a nephew .
And you make soup .
These agents -- they come for me ?
No , me .
To kill you ?
No , to save me .
You try to save this one by bringing me evidence he is dead .
Call it a final attempt to end the bloodshed between his family and yours .
I 'm sure you knew it must fail , which leaves me to wonder , Henrietta Lange , why , exactly , did you come ?
She went to protect Callen .
Callen 's perfectly capable of protecting himself .
And then some .
Mm .
So why did she go ?
Director Vance said it was a thin file .
Maybe there wasn 't enough evidence to make a case .
Hmm , but she must have known
Callen would have come after her .
Wherever Callen goes , Sam goes , and Kensi .
And Deeks .
What if she couldn 't get approval to run the operation , so instead she puts herself out there , knows they 'll all come to back her up ?
Kind of a desperate play .
Yeah , but what if she had no choice ?
They were about to come after Callen .
Offense is the best defense .
Mm .
Wait , what did you say ?
Offense is the best defense ?
No , no , before that , you said it was a thin file .
I didn 't say that ; Director Vance did .
I heard him telling Callen .
Okay , but the file Hetty erased was a big file -- 20 megabytes , at least ; hundreds of pages .
Maybe it was all for show so we 'd stop looking ?
Two files .
A fat file for show and a thin file , and if she only erased one ...
Then the real Comescu file is still in there .
You gonna tell me what spooked you ?
You said I had 30 minutes ; it 's only been seven .
How long is it gonna take you to tell me ?
About a minute .
Then you got 22 minutes .
Good .
That 's the third time you 've stripped that pistol .
You 'll wear it out .
Yeah , just load your ammo , okay ?
Those memories I told you about -- the guy giving me the toy soldier .
I always just assumed that 's where it took place -- on a local beach , kids playing .
I was making sand castles .
This is where I 'm from , Sam .
How can you be so sure ?
I remembered ... ... a woman .
My mother .
They shot her .
If you tell me ... how this all started ... ... I 'll tell you why I came .
In the war ... my grandfather did what he had to do to keep his family safe .
Safe from the death camps .
Late in the war , there was a coup .
The power shifted .
From being someone the government could rely on , my grandfather became someone to be despised .
There was an American .
OSS .
You know of the OSS ?
Now the ClA .
This American hunted my grandfather down and killed him , along with two of his brothers .
This OSS agent was
Callen 's grandfather .
And the Comescu family responded in kind ?
It took two years to find him .
He had married a Roma girl , they had ... a child .
My father was the one to find him .
The mother and child -- a daughter -- escaped to America .
But it didn 't end there .
25 years later , the daughter came back .
She had changed her name .
She had two children .
A girl and a boy .
My father swore on his father 's grave to end their bloodline .
She died not far from here on a beach while her son played .
He won 't go easily .
No , he won 't .
It is in his blood .
Why did you come ?
To make amends .
Big smile .
This one 's going to be for the album .
What album is this ?
Honeymoon , yeah ?
Honeymoon ?
We are on honeymoon in Romania ?
Romantic Romania .
Look at this place -- it 's perfect .
Yeah ?
Well ,
I don 't see a ring on this finger , lover- boy .
Well , that 's because you , darling ,
left it at the hotel when we went swimming .
Swimming ?
And our swimsuits are ... ?
Optional .
Our swimsuits are optional .
Actually , you know what ?
There 's a swimsuit- optional beach right up there , and , yep , the batteries are fully charged .
We could do this .
Yeah , well , I 'm really sorry , not today , little brother .
Little brother -- are you kidding me ?
Why 's it always got to be the brother- sister thing with you ?
Well , we 're on a family vacation , so keep snapping .
All right .
Two guys leaving the house .
Well , it hasn 't been partitioned on the main drive .
Nothing on the user or new file logs .
It 's not here .
It 's got to be here .
It can 't be anywhere else .
Okay , so if you were Hetty , where would you hide a file on a server that you didn 't want anyone else to find ?
In plain sight .
She wouldn 't , would she ?
She made a simple copy and parked it .
The Comescu file has been right there all along .
What now ?
Zulu- November- Tango- 1179 -- the director 's access code .
We could get fired .
Your computer .
Hmm , looks like someone got access to the Comescu family album .
The captions are translated .
" Vasile with Dracul and Ilena on his birthday , 1987 . "
" Ilena with Auntie Alexa at the beach house . "
" Dracul , Vasile , Ion , Alexa , and Ilena at Uncle Petru 's , January 2011 . "
Look at Ilena 's face -- it 's completely out of focus .
" Ilena 's welcome home party , 2009 . "
Can you unblur them ?
Maybe .
Here they come .
Female visitor .
Why would the Comescus blur her face ?
The blurring was done after it was downloaded onto our server .
The Comescus didn 't do it .
We did .
That 's a warm welcome , little kissy- kissy .
They 've obviously met before .
That can 't be .
What ?
Who is it ?
It 's Hunter .
Vance must have sent her .
But how did she know where to find them ?
She 's got to be undercover .
Maybe it 's not her first time at the beach house .
Yeah , they 've clearly met before .
She 's undercover ... she targets him , picks him up at a bar or the gym ... starts dating him .
Gets invited home to meet the family .
That 's what I 'd do .
What do do ?
Having her in the house changes the plan .
We have a plan ?
Yeah .
Kill 'em all .
The mobile customer you are trying to call is not available or out of range .
Please --
We 're going to have to tell the director .
What , that we illegally used his password to access an Eyes Only file ?
He must know what 's in the file .
I wouldn 't be so sure .
I mean , Hetty had two files .
Maybe she had more .
Maybe she only showed him what she needed him to know .
What , like , a plausible deniability kind of thing ?
More like a Hetty trying to save her butt kind of thing .
Okay , Eric , Hetty doesn 't work here anymore .
Director Vance is our boss now .
And always has been .
Director Vance .
I thought Hetty had a rule about eating in ops , Eric .
Um , she does .
She did .
Do you have anything to report ?
Nothing .
That can 't wait .
I need you to locate an active GPS device .
Who are we tracking ?
Agent Hunter .
Excellent .
Tracking GPS .
Overlaying pictometry .
All right , she 's at a beach house on the Black Sea .
Or at least her GPS tracker is .
Who owns this beach house , Eric ?
Um ...
Property is owned by a company registered in the Cayman Islands .
CF& Q Limited .
Three listed directors --
Alexa Comescu , Vasile Comescu and Dracul Comescu .
How do you say " bingo " in Romanian ?
Bingo .
Bingo .
In the camp of the enemy .
How did she know to go there ?
That 's a very good question , Miss Jones .
Why hasn 't she called ?
So , basically , those were Callan 's instructions .
So that 's the plan -- just kill them all ?
Yep .
Mm- hmm .
Has anyone figured out exactly how we 're going to do that ?
No , not yet .
Right , okay .
Well , listen ...
I 'm on my third gelato here , and I 'm beginning to wonder if my new wife has up and dumped me , but ...
I think you mean sister .
Okay , fine .
My sister .
Thank you .
And I was ...
Hold on .
What 's happening ?
Deeks ?
Hello ?
Okay , I 'm starting to feel exposed here .
I think I 'm going to move .
I will , uh , I 'll call you back .
Deeks good ?
Yeah .
Moving position .
You see any electronic security ?
Cameras ?
Sensors ?
Just lots of guards .
A dozen on the grounds at least ; probably more inside .
Going to have to draw them out .
Need a diversion .
Oh , joy .
Really ?
Luka !
I hate Romania !
There 's stairs up from the beach here , but all the beach approaches are heavily guarded , so ...
I got three prisoners .
Where ?
Right behind me .
Okay , make that one prisoner and two dead guys .
Over !
You got made ?
I didn 't get made . you definitely got made .
Not because of anything that I did .
One gelato too many .
Dracul Nicolae Comescu .
Well , I definitely didn 't get made .
They knew who to look for .
Looks like somebody knew we were coming .
This narrows down our options .
We get within a hundred feet of that place , we 're compromised .
And we still don 't know if Hetty 's even there .
Think they got a chance to call it in ?
I didn 't wait around to find out .
As soon as I got made -- spotted -- I took off .
They were snapping at my heels .
Maybe not .
We need to move before they miss these guys .
What about Hunter ?
There 's no photo of her .
We got to assume her cover 's still intact .
What cover might that be ?
Who is she ?
It 's a good- looking woman , Sam .
You think she 's his girlfriend ?
A woman like that wants a man with power and money .
You got power and money , Dracul ?
Didn 't think so .
He 's just tenth- rate muscle , 20 times removed from the head of the family .
What 's her name ?
Why don 't you knock on the door and ask her yourself .
Right answer .
We just might do that .
What do you know of the boy on the beach ?
His time should have ended with his mother .
This was a mistake .
Instead , he grew into a man .
You know a lot about him then .
More than you .
More than he knows about himself .
Who he is .
From where he comes .
He was given his grandfather 's name -- Callen .
Yes .
What about his first name ?
You know what it is ?
What is this thing you did that was so bad that you must come to my house and die to make your amends ?
It 's not what I did .
It 's what I didn 't do .
What I couldn 't do .
Save her .
Save his mother .
And we are on stream .
Ready to track Hunter 's cell phone .
Colonel , thank you for making this happen .
Take care .
Yes , you , too .
Low orbit , oblique angles -- so coverage could be a little scratchy .
What 's our window , Eric ?
We 've tasked a small target area , only two square miles , so our window 's less than 15 seconds , starting in ten .
Big screen , Eric .
And we are capturing data .
Every pinpoint of light is an active GPS cell phone .
Romanians love their cell phones .
Data capture terminating in three , two , one .
And the show 's over .
We got it , I hope .
Just need to overlay it with our satellite imagery and we are good to snoop .
Okay .
Let 's see .
Agent Hunter 's cell phone .
Now for the fun part .
Let 's start with all calls over the last 24 hours and check for callbacks .
And we have a winner .
Three calls to the same number .
Looks like a cell phone registered to the same Comescu family company that owns the beach house .
Local search , Eric .
Got it .
The cell phone 's just a couple blocks from Hunter 's current location .
Not residential .
Guessing a light industrial area .
Business is bad .
Hardly any active cell phones .
Although four are in the same building as our guy .
Whoever he is , he 's got company .
Huh ... the four numbers are sequential .
Means they were bought at the same time .
Burn phones .
Bought where , Eric ?
Prague Airport yesterday .
I think we just found Callen .
Or their cell phones .
Well , they 're all in close proximity .
I 'm guessing same room .
Which means they could have one of the Comescus .
Or Comescu could have all of them .
Text message , Eric .
Who to ?
All four of them .
Maybe one of them will answer .
So what do you want to do with him ?
We could tie him up , call an ambulance , once we 're clear of the beach house .
Or do you have something else in mind ?
Your call .
I found something .
It 's in his address book .
Tell me about Ilena .
She 's not the woman you should fear .
You still want to be breathing when you walk out of here , you tell me about her .
You think she 's my girlfriend ?
Tell me !
I 've known her all my life .
We played together when we were children .
Ilena is my cousin .
Oh , I 'm so not expecting a phone call .
They found us .
Eric 's good .
Eric and Nell are good .
This is Eric .
It 's Callen .
Uh , hold for Director Vance .
It 's Callen .
You 're a long way from home , Agent Callen .
Well , a couple of days ago ,
I would have agreed with you .
Right now , I 'm not so sure .
Is your team okay ?
Not my team .
Hetty 's team , then .
We 're fine .
Have you found her ?
She 's in a beach house a couple blocks from where we are .
I see .
Anything else ?
They knew we were coming .
They 've been tracking us since we landed in Prague .
Have you heard the name , Ilena Vadim ?
No , I haven 't , but it appears that Eric and Miss Jones have .
There were two Comescu files on the server .
Ilena 's face had been blurred out .
Eric unblurred it .
Ilena Vadim and Agent Hunter appear to be the same person .
Agent Hunter has been gathering intel in Romania on the Comescu case for the past three months .
But some of the photos go back further than three months .
How much further ?
At least two years .
Some to when she was a little girl .
The photo captions suggest she 's one of the family .
Cousins , according to Dracul Comescu .
And you believe him , Callen ?
He has no reason to lie .
Somebody told them we were coming .
The Comescus are in the human traffic business .
They pay corrupt officials to keep them informed .
Okay , well , that is one explanation .
I don 't want to believe the other explanation , Agent Callen .
Incoming call -- Comescu 's phone .
It 's Hunter .
He 's with me .
Callen .
You 're here already .
Dracul couldn 't make it to the phone .
He 's dead ?
Bleeding .
Where are you ?
Close enough to see you arrive at the beach house .
Hetty ?
I haven 't seen her yet .
But they 're keeping her alive to flush you out .
Well , it 's working .
How do you want to do this ?
I am open to suggestions .
Tell me where you are .
An old auto workshop .
Two blocks off Main Street , one block south .
There 's a broken gas pump in front .
Give me ten minutes .
Ten minutes .
Get that ?
Agent Callen , do you have a plan ?
I gave up being an agent when I turned in my badge .
You didn 't turn in your badge .
You mistakenly left it on Hetty 's desk .
I put it in her drawer for safekeeping .
Do you have a plan ?
Yeah .
Enlighten me .
Save Hetty .
Carry on , Agent Callen .
Hunter 's on our side .
I mean , she has to be , right ?
So ... you knew his mother .
Yes .
Tell me ...
Ilena was taken away by her father after her mother died .
Two years ago , she came back to us .
Came back to you ?
She 's my niece .
Kensi , Deeks , go , go , go .
I counted 12 .
Evens up the odds .
Only until they discover we 've gone .
You see Hunter ?
Nope .
On your right !
Hetty .
I know who you are .
I know your family .
I know everything about you .
When did you trust me ?
Not until you pulled the trigger .
You 're good ?
Mm .
You didn 't play with Dracul when you were kids .
That would be his real cousin , Ilena , who 's happily married in Argentina and wants nothing to do with her family .
And you came back as Ilena .
They wanted to believe their niece would come back to them one day .
But why you ?
For what ?
This .
We good ?
We 're good .
Hetty , time to hustle .
Deeks and Kensi are at the car .
Hetty ?
Hetty ?
== sync , corrected by ==
Breathe deeply .
You 're doing great .
Watch the baby 's heartbeat .
Let 's give it one more try before going for a C- section .
Where 's her husband ?
He 's ...
He 's not here .
Isn 't it past ten ?
The President 's late .
His escort ran late , apparently .
He 's on his way right now , sir .
OK .
Teams , report your current status .
Drive away !
Congratulations .
A baby boy .
We have a news flash .
At 10 : 28 Burmese local time ...
Just a moment .
A bomb went off at the Aung San Mausoleum in Burma .
17 Koreans died , including officials , bodyguards , and reporters .
We 've also learned there were four Burmese casualties .
our President was scheduled to pay his respects at the mausoleum ...
We mourn the 17 men ... who perished at Burma 's Aung San Mausoleum .
May they rest in peace .
This is truly a sad day for us .
Those lunatics .
It 's been barely a year since the Korean Air bombing .
They aren 't doing themselves any favors here .
The perpetrators confessed .
We caught one of them trying to blow up a house to kill himself .
They 're North Korean soldiers and their mission was ... to assassinate our very own President .
It 's war they want .
How dare they threaten our President .
Burma suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea .
I can 't believe our government isn 't doing anything about this .
It 's obvious the ministers want someone else to take care of things .
What ARE we doing ?
We must act .
Then ...
Let 's do something .
Do you agree ?
I agree with you .
We must .
What do we have to lose ?
Very well .
We shall retaliate .
We have decided to make the North pay for the Aung San bombing .
only five men know about operation Clean sweep .
We won 't inform the President .
What is your plan ?
Infiltrate Pyeongyang and kill 30 top North Korean officials .
Are you in ?
We have to make them pay .
I will go .
You stay here .
You have a family now .
Kyung- hee .
Mu- yeol .
How are you feeling ?
I 'm sorry .
Is this our son ?
Let me see .
He 's very handsome .
I 'm your daddy .
I heard you gave mommy a hard time .
Congratulations , Kyung- hee .
That 's Mrs. Lee to you .
Thanks for coming back alive .
The news scared me so much .
You didn 't worry about me ?
Watch it .
Why should she worry about you ?
You 're not my husband , are you ?
No need to be so mean .
I 'll get married sooner or later .
You two need to catch up .
See you .
I 'm coming , too .
Hey .
I 'm really sorry , but I have to go somewhere .
Where ?
Mu- yeol .
It 's fine .
I think I 'll be away for a while .
For how long ?
Let 's name him when I get back .
I want his name to include sung .
Is it something dangerous ?
Don 't worry .
I will come back to you .
And to our son .
Salute .
Lee Min- gu , explosives expert .
Song Ho- il , sharpshooter .
ParkJi- goon , knife- thrower .
Moon Sam- soo , North Korea 's Head of Security ...
He lives on the 3rd floor of Chullima Apartment Block 2 .
Lee Min- gu .
Yes , sir .
Song Ho- il .
Yes , sir .
Take him down .
Lastly , oh Jung- man , Chief of Kim Jong- il 's Guards .
Jin- pyo and I will kill him .
Attention .
Salute .
You 're well prepared .
OK back to your old selves in just a matter of days .
We 're ready to leave this minute .
I know Pyeongyang like the back of my hand .
We 've had enough training .
I 'm proud of you , all 21 of you .
I , Choi Eung- chan , swear on my own life that ...
I will do whatever it takes to bring you back safely .
That 's a promise as a fellow Korean , a fellow soldier , and a brother .
You promised , sir .
Hello again , North Korean dog tags .
With these tags and uniforms , I bet we look just like them .
Don 't you think Lee looks North Korean ?
Leave at daybreak and split up into teams .
You have 24 hours .
Then regroup at Nampo Pier and board the submarine home .
I wish you all the best .
What 's going on here ?
The President is adamant that we do not retaliate .
What about the men we sent ?
This is special liquor .
Dear Leader gives bottles to his most loyal men .
We must cover it up ?
A submarine is waiting to pick them up .
I will talk to the President .
Wait .
If we show any signs of retaliation , then the US ... will not offer its assistance with future security issues .
You know we need their help .
That 's not all .
The President knows that the public hates all things communist .
He doesn 't see the need to fight back .
What about our men ?
The men who risked their lives for us .
Let me spell it out for you .
For the greater good of our country , we need to kill them ...
That 's absurd .
Have you forgotten the rage that made you agree to Clean sweep ?
We have a duty to bring our men back safely .
Is that really our duty ?
You know how unpopular our President is right now .
He can 't risk too much .
Why don 't you just be honest ?
Ambassador to the US .
Head of NlS .
Defense Minister .
Finance Minister .
You 're just afraid the President will find out and make you resign .
Isn 't that what this is about ?
What ?
How dare you .
Don 't you think you 're out of line ?
Do we have to sacrifice 21 more innocent lives ?
If the operation ... becomes known , we might have to sacrifice many more than that .
We 're all in agreement .
It 's just you left , now .
Mu- yeol .
Stay awake .
You can 't fall asleep .
Mu- yeol .
Mu- yeol .
It 's cold .
I can 't feel my leg .
Mu- yeol .
Look , the submarine 's here for us .
Hang in there .
What 's going on ?
Gunshots !
Duck !
We 're Koreans !
Why ? !
Why are you killing us ? !
Mu- yeol .
Mu- yeol .
Mu- yeol .
I knew Iâ€™ d never survive this mission .
Get back home .
Look after Kyung- hee and our boy .
No .
That 's your job , not mine .
Mu- yeol .
Mu- yeol .
Mu- yeol .
I loved you , my friend .
Mu- yeol .
They 're all dead ?
Got it .
All members of Team operation Clean sweep are dead .
Their records will show that they all went missing in action .
Now it 's up to us five to forget .
oh , fine , fine .
If you 'll excuse me , I have a party to attend .
There are chrysanthemums everywhere , in the north and the south .
I can smell them even now .
You still have a tiny bit of conscience left . our dog tags are still on your desk .
I 'm here for the life you promised .
I 'm sorry .
I had no choice .
Sorry , but I lost 20 men .
I watched them all die by the hands of someone our government sent !
We had to ... choose between the lives of 21 men or nuclear protection from the US .
our nation 's security was at stake .
We went for what the President wanted .
It was for the nation ?
Get this .
We are willing to die for our nation .
But not for the government .
Especially not for a government that thinks nothing of us .
You 're the last person I thought would betray us .
We swore to fight and die together .
Kill me .
Mr. Choi .
Are you in ?
Satellite photos of air force bases on the Pacific Rim .
We think a fighter jet left one of these bases to bomb the KAL plane .
Sir .
You left the window open on such a windy night .
oh , it was a bit stuffy .
You can go .
Good night , sir .
You betrayed 20 young men .
I will make you pay .
My baby .
No .
Not my baby .
No !
No .
My baby .
My baby .
My baby !
No .
Please .
" Mu- yeol is dead . "
" I will raise your son well . "
" You need to forget him to be happy . "
" Start a new life . "
" You deserve much better . "
Shut him up or I 'll kill you both .
Mu- yeol .
I named the boy Yoon- sung .
But he 's a Lee like me , not a Park like you .
I will make them pay in the worst way possible .
That 's the only reason I 'm still alive .
Boss .
He stole our dope .
What should we do with him ?
Didn 't I tell you we don 't sell to Korea ?
But I ...
Concentrate .
Aim down the sideline .
one knee .
Dad .
Did you see me ?
I hit the target .
Head , neck , chest .
or you die first .
Most of the kids miss the target completely , boss .
He did really well .
Time for martial arts class .
Go .
As you wish , boss .
Is that all you can do ? !
Hit it harder !
Mom ?
What 's that ?
It 's nothing .
Let me see .
There 's nothing to see .
Is she my mom ?
My mom ?
I wish I had a mom like my nanny .
Why don 't I have a mom ?
Can I at least have a photo of her ?
Please ?
I said she 's dead .
Forget about her .
She IS my mom .
My own mom .
Puchai .
Come over here .
What was that ?
A monkey stepped on a landmine .
Keep watch .
Puchai .
Puchai .
Puchai !
I didn 't cheat .
I did nothing wrong .
I swear , I swear I ...
Wait , wait , wait .
Do you know how much you lost me , punk ?
Mister , are you Korean ?
Cool , you 're the first Korean I 've seen here .
You , you 're Korean , too ?
He 's got a few thugs with him .
Let 's go .
Where , where to ?
Someplace else .
Move it .
Snake , snake , snake , snake .
Snake , snake .
Come on .
No , wait .
Move it .
I really didn 't cheat , OK ?
Mister .
Jump , jump .
Just jump .
Look , he 's dead .
You won 't die .
Mister .
That way , that way .
Don 't move .
Those morons thought they had me .
How dare they think they could get me .
Where are we headed ?
What if you stepped on a landmine out there ?
Another thing .
Didn 't I tell you never to bring a stranger into our compound ?
We can 't risk being located .
I couldn 't sit and watch someone die .
He 's a Korean , too .
He 'll die just the same , whether it 's here or there .
You .
Yes ?
Uh , yes , sir .
What can you do ?
Cook .
I can cook .
I was a chef on a ship .
Are you hungry ?
You 're the best .
Dad .
It 's so good .
Doesn 't that taste like it 's pure Korean ?
I tweaked the local tom yum recipe .
And with the cabbage ...
What 's your name ?
It 's Bae Shik- joong .
It sounds a bit like the Korean word for freeloader .
My grandfather named me .
Bae Shik- joong .
Yes .
Try to escape and you die .
Stay here and cook .
Sure .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Who 's he ?
Him ?
My dad .
Your name is Puchai ?
Korean name 's Lee Yoon- sung .
Here I 'm Puchai .
What 's this ?
She 's so pretty .
Who is she ?
Your daughter ?
Pretty , huh ?
You have decent standards .
Let me see .
What 's her name ?
Kim Nana .
Kim Nana ?
Different family name .
She 's not your daughter ?
Hey .
Give it back .
Later .
That 's my dad 's room , this is mine .
What 's he doing ?
Sleeping ?
Boss .
Why don 't you lie down ...
What ?
Huh ?
I just wanted to suggest you lie down and ...
Get lost .
Good night .
That 's how he sleeps .
He sleeps like that ?
I 'm sure his bum hurts .
I 've never seen him lie down even once .
How strange .
Very strange .
You can sleep here .
OK , thank you .
I bet not even Buddha sleeps like that .
I can try ?
No way , my dad will kill me .
Do you know your nanny 's husband ran off with some drugs ?
Dad .
Shoot the targets .
Miss and she dies .
What her husband did wasn 't her fault .
I 'm the leader here !
My rule is to kill the betrayer and the whole family .
Show some mercy every now and again .
There 's this thing called forgiveness .
Watch how I enforce my laws .
Dad .
Please .
Please .
Puchai .
OK , fine .
I 'll do it .
I 'll shoot .
If I shoot all three targets , you forgive her .
OK .
I 'll give this forgiveness a try .
How can you shoot someone you care for ?
I hate living like this .
I bet you 're so happy living in Seoul .
Puchai .
Puchai , careful .
Stay back .
Nanny .
Get up , we have to go .
Wake up , please .
open your eyes .
I 'll kill them all .
Hey .
You can 't go alone !
Puchai .
Just one second .
That 's all it takes to lose control and step on a landmine .
Dad ...
You should 've killed them all the day you saved Shik- joong . one survivor can come back to kill you .
Dad , don 't die .
Please , dad .
Dad .
Don 't die .
Dad .
Please .
Dad ...
Yoon- sung .
I don 't mind losing a leg .
At least you 're alive .
Take this drug .
I will remove the shrapnel and stitch it fast .
You 're losing too much blood .
Scalpel .
Scalpel ?
There 's a gunshot wound on my left shoulder .
Cut into it .
Dad ...
Just do it , now .
You 'll find a bullet in there .
Yoon- sung .
Listen to what I say very carefully .
It 's about your real father .
Dad .
What do you mean by that ?
17 years ago .
20 young men were betrayed by their government .
Your father was wounded in that mission .
He saved me ... by taking the bullet meant for me .
That bullet ...
went through your father 's heart and into my shoulder .
He 's the reason why I survived .
He died so that I might live .
And I 've lived to help avenge him .
Yoon- sung .
You must live ...
and shoot the evil hearts of those who betrayed us .
So that 's why ...
That 's why you put me through years of training ?
To avenge him ?
Dad .
We have to operate quickly .
It 's becoming life- threatening .
Come on , we have to operate .
Save my dad .
Puchai .
Come over here .
Don 't die , Mu- yeol .
Kyung- hee .
I 'm sorry .
I had no choice .
Who killed my father ?
Five men conspired .
Say I kill all five .
Can you and I ... move to some other place ... and live in secret ?
I have one last thing to ask you .
My mom .
Is she alive ?
She is .
I will change .
It 's my destiny .
Hello ?
You 've arrived .
I just got here .
Your first target is Lee Kyung- wan .
Forget your life in the States .
But never forget your father 's death .
OK .
Stop here for a minute .
Don 't fall in love .
Everyone around you will die the minute you are exposed .

â™ª â™ª
Run , Leela !
They 're bouncing right at us .
So , anybody hungry ?
I could stuff myself .
I 'll use that free app that tells what restaurants you 're near .
You mean the window ?
Yes .
I am lrrr , ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8 !
I demand extra dipping sauce !
How many ?
I don 't know .
Two ?
Welcome to Fishy Joe 's .
Today is Stroganoff Thursday .
We are currently out of the following menu items .
Stroganoff .
May I take your order ?
I 'll have the Stroganoff .
Okay .
Yeah , uh , give me the fried spaghetti- dinner breakfast pocket for lunch , and a big bucket of mixed sodas .
One kids ' meal .
Got it .
Huh .
Buggalo tots ?
What exactly are those made out of ?
You got a warrant ?
I 'll just have something from the lite menu .
How about the gardener- lover 's salad ?
What kind of cheese filling you want in that ?
Ugh !
Just give me the fruit cup .
Okeydoke .
What kind of cheese filling you want in that ?
Oh , God .
Fruit is spelled f- r- o- o- t .
And it 's got quotation marks around it .
Mmm .
There 's nothing wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal .
Heart ... at- tack .
I 'm fine .
Oh !
I got a bone in my fruit !
That 's it .
From now on , we 're not eating anything unless we know what it is and where it 's from .
We 're going to the local farmers market .
Aw , mom , do we have to ?
This is what I 'm talking about .
See all the dirt and earwigs ?
That 's the sign of healthy food .
You think that 's healthy , try this .
I found it growing at the bottom of my hamper .
Mmm , so fresh and musty .
It 's what I do .
Hello , tiny man .
You want sample small- batch Amazonian maple syrup ?
Sure .
Mm .
Ah !
That 's the kind of sap I like .
the kind of sap like .
I 'm scare- roused .
Zuban tobacco ? !
The richest , most obnoxious kind !
Listen , pal , I 'm looking for a versatile smoke , one that 's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the pope .
Forget the pope , my friend .
Smoke one of these , and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you .
Ooh !
Heirloom eggs ?
That 's so life- affirming .
I 'll bet you run your own hatchery , just you and your wife ...
Matilda .
No , ma 'am .
Matilda and I gather them eggs in the forest .
And Matilda 's really more of a mongoose than a wife .
You 're a lucky man .
But are they way more expensive than regular eggs ?
Way more .
Ooh !
I 'll take a dozen .
What ?
You 're not my breakfast friends .
What are you doing here ?
Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy , organic food .
Blackmail ?
What does she have on you ?
As long as we eat her filthy scrambled eggs , you 'll never find out .
They 're not filthy .
They 're wholesome , fertile and fresh from the forest floor .
There 's some filth .
" Fertile " ?
What does that mean ?
It means it will hatch into a tiny , little , infant creature unless we cook it first .
Hey , Leela , hurry up with those scrambled infants .
What ? !
That 's horrifying !
Zoidberg , you 're an inhuman monster .
What are you , my driver 's license ?
Eating a sweet innocent chick before it 's even hatched ?
Oh , no , you won 'tn 't !
I refuse to eat an unborn animal .
I 'm going to keep this egg safe and warm and secure until it hatches out into the world .
And then I 'm going to eat it . â™ª â™ª
Should we turn on the TV ?
Nah .
Bender , do you mind ?
I 'm roosting .
I 'm considering buying a yacht to house my thoroughbreds .
How do you expect me to do that without smoking a cigar ?
Think of the unborn embryo .
That 's what I 'm gonna call the yacht .
Hey !
Leggo my eggo , crabbo !
Stop it , Fry .
That 's sexual harassment .
Yeah , come down off your round , white pulpit .
You 're just going to eat that thing anyway .
I was , but you can 't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it .
Whoever 's in here deserves a chance at life .
A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man ,
like I did as a baby .
And so I make this solemn vow .
To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful , innocent creature enters this world happy , healthy , and ...
All yours , Zoidberg .
Aw , look at the cute little ...
Aah !
I was gonna go yachting in those feet !
Relax , you babies .
It 's no different from stomping a puppy .
Everyone , stop !
He 's not going to hurt you .
I 'm standing in a pool of my own feet .
Bender 's right .
Kill it before someone names it !
No !
Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend .
Oy .
Look , I know he 's ugly , and kind of corrosive , but we can 't murder someone just 'cause he 's hideous and annoying .
That 's what we said about Zoidberg , and look where that got us .
Amy has a point .
Mr. Peppy 's not like Zoidberg .
He 's my friend .
Aw ... â™ª â™ª
â™ª â™ª
Where to , adulterers ?
Calculon ? !
Then it wasn 't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off .
What bomb ?
It takes more than that to surprise me ...
Bender .
What you doing , little buddy ?
Uh , yeah , Uncle Bender -- he 's your friend .
Huh ?
Oh , you want to play fetch .
Come on , boy , get the ball .
Dumb jerk .
Come on , get the ball .
Sweet freak of Mozambique , that thing 's colossal !
It 's gonna kill us all .
It 's so huge .
How big does one of those things get ?
Well , that depends on what one of those things is .
That seems like a fact worth knowing .
Good startling news , everyone .
I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual .
Just as I feared .
Attack- type J.
No !
Yes !
It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton ,
leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh .
Ew !
Hence , the Latin name or as you non- catholics would say , the Bone Vampire .
That 's ridiculous !
Mr. Peppy doesn 't eat bones .
I raised him on a simple diet of brussels sprouts and mixed soda .
At least there 's only one of them .
The good news is , they can 't start breeding .
The bad news , everyone , is , the beast reproduces asexually .
A single bone vampire , left alone with some quiet music and some bone vampire porn , could produce dozens of deadly offspring .
That lucky bastard .
I say kill it !
But it loves me , and I love it !
Kill them both !
Killing them seems like a hassle .
Can 't we just set it free to live with its own kind ?
Poor , ignorant Leela .
The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet .
That 's perfect .
We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species .
Yeah , let 's do those Leela things .
Well , buddy , how do you like your new home ?
See , he 's happy already .
That thing doesn 't have emotions , Fry .
Its brain is the size of a walnut .
So are walnuts , and they 're delicious .
I 'll miss you , Mr. Peppy , but you 'll be happier here .
So go on , go .
G- good- bye , Mr. Peppy .
Come on , man , don 't do this .
Go on now .
I mean it , don 't make this any harder than it has to be .
It 's time to let go .
Ow !
Thanks , Leela , he just needed a little extra push .
Come on , Fry , let 's go home and
Hold up , there 's alcohol around here somewhere .
My tanqueraydar is going crazy .
Aha !
Thought you could get away from me , huh ?
You lose again , you stupid intoxicant .
â™ª â™ª
We 're not from around here .
Hello .
Excuse me , but we 're guests on your planet .
Speak English !
Behave yourselves , gents .
Offworlders best be welcome here , especially if we 're trying to get the Olympics .
May I buy you a drink ?
We don 't get a lot of pretty faces around here .
Uh , sure , but I 'm driving .
I 'll just have the smallest whiskey you 've got .
A small aquarium of whiskey for the busty lass .
Thanks .
I suppose I should know your name if I 'm going to be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you .
Maczongo .
Angus Maczongo .
Major Angus Maczongo .
Handsome Major Angus Maczongo , Esquire .
Ooh , handsome and Esquire .
I 'm Turanga Leela .
My crew and I are from Earth .
So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6 ?
We just released an endangered animal back into the wild -- a bone vampire .
No need to thank us .
Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all .
Dear God , you brought back the bone vampire ? !
The damned things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries .
Aye , until Maczongo here shot 'em all into extinction , he did .
Now we 've got more livestock than we can slaughter .
Oh , aye , 'tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager .
We kinna have no murdering bone vampires back here .
Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleeding planet .
No !
Angus is right .
I thought you were named Angus .
We 're all named Angus .
Please , Mr. Peppy won 't attack your livestock .
He 's a vegetarian , and he 's not even preachy about it .
Poppycock .
Once he gets the smell of bones , there 'll be no stopping him .
Tonight , Mr. Peppy must die .
Angus , wait , my strictly platonic friend is right .
At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it .
The last time I hesitated , a bone vampire snicked out me left shin .
Please , just a few days .
Well , 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other .
The beast lives ... for now .
Thank you , Angus .
You 're welcome !
I don 't trust that Maczongo .
Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy .
Don 't worry about Maczongo .
He and I are having brunch tomorrow .
I 'm thinking of wearing this .
It 's nice , but there 's still something
I don 't like about that guy .
My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of his shins .
What is it ?
It killed little Angus !
They 're all dead , and their bones are gone .
This was no accident .
Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless , Fry ?
He wouldn 't do this in our sleep .
He would not , could not to a sheep .
The deal is off .
The beast must die .
Ooh , pimpy .
What are we supposed to do , just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed ?
Sounds like a plan .
Guess I 'll pass the time by lighting up an El Jerko .
Okay , that 's it .
I need some air .
Who 's there ?
Hermes , is this one of your zany practical jokes ?
Leela , are you okay ?
Did you drink too many aquaria ?
Look , the bone vampire .
Mr. Peppy attacked me .
Quick , count my bones .
There should be 205 .
Okay , that 's better .
Keep 'em coming .
I 'm sorry , Fry , but no vegetarian could have done this .
I know , and as much as I love Mr. Peppy , I love Leela more .
He has to be ... ... Put down .
Aw , don 't feel bad .
Major Maczongo is an experienced hunter .
He 'll blow Mr. Peppy 's head off as painlessly as possible .
No , not Maczongo .
If anyone is going to kill Mr. Peppy , it should be me .
Fry , I know you 're upset right now , but I hope you 'll consider donating the body to science dinner .
Here , Mr. Peppy .
Mmm , lovely bones .
We 've been walking for hours .
I hope we can find our way back .
Don 't worry , I left a trail of bread crumbs .
And I left a trail of cigars .
You don 't have to do this , Fry .
Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion .
Thanks , Leela , but I have no choice .
I can 't let my monstrous deboner get anywhere near you .
There it is !
Well , this is it .
You guys wait here .
This is going to kill him more than it does me .
Good- bye , boy .
I 'll think of you whenever I sit on something round .
What 's happening ?
Did you kill it ?
The bloody idiot bloody shot me .
I 'm all bloody bloody !
Mr. Peppy , bullets make you talk ?
That 's not Mr. Peppy .
Jinkies , he Scooby- Dooed us .
Why , Major Maczongo , why ?
Oh , it 's been 30 years since last I killed a bone vampire .
The villagers dinna idolize me like they used to .
You seemed pretty popular at the pub .
I work there as a greeter .
Your beast was my chance to be a hero again , but the damn thing was a vegetarian , so I slaughtered the sheep myself .
But why did you attack me ?
So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature .
Us greeters don 't get a lot of action .
On paper it seemed like a win- win situation .
Do you realize what this means , Fry ?
Your pet 's not dangerous after all .
I told you Mr. Peppy 's a lover , not a fighter ,
like Dwayne " The Rock " " The Tooth Fairy " Johnson .
Hey , what 's that bone- sucking sound ?
It 's Mr. Peppy .
I 'd know him anywhere .
Huh , so apparently Major Maczongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep- killing .
Why , Mr. Peppy , why ?
Ooh , that tickles .
Now I really do have to kill you .
Wait , don 't shoot .
The beast is a godsend .
Like I said , we 've more livestock than we can slaughter , but thanks to this ravenous bogle , that 's nae more a problem .
Angus is right .
The cursed thing even debones 'em , which is perfect for today 's fast- paced , lazy consumer .
The beast must live !
You know what the best part is ?
From now on , whenever we 're eating fresh , organic space- meat , we 'll know exactly where it comes from .
One bucket of double- fried , triple- salted , boneless sheep tots , please .
What kind of cheese filling you want in that ?
All kinds .
Eh , make it two ,
My name is Warwick Davis .
I 'm an actor ...
Yeah , evil toilet dwarf . ' .. soon to be divorced . '
You don 't live here any more .
Still my house .
' I 'm an entrepreneur . '
Give me five grand , just to live on .
' And I 've got a massive tax bill . '
You should do any shit job that comes along , or you will go to jail .
I am on my way to see a man who 's very important to me .
His name is Bryan , and he 's my spiritual counsellor , and life coach .
And he phoned me and he said , " Warwick , with everything that 's going on at the minute ,
" have you been neglecting your spiritual life ? " And I said , " Yes , I have . "
And he said , " I knew that . "
And he was totally right , as always .
Oh , hello .
Well , well , well , long time no see !
Yeah .
Brenda , two teas , please .
Hey , come on .
Oi , you two .
Hey , Ying and Yang .
' Bryan is my ...
' what he calls psychic housekeeper . '
Sometimes I stand here and I feel like I 'm one of the plants , and they 're looking after me .
Do you know what I mean by that ?
' He deals with all the sort of spiritual clutter ' that accumulates inside me .
West , east .
' I told him about the divorce ... '
East- Chinese food , healthy food , tai chi , oxen .
' And straight away he said I needed to go and see him ... '
West .
You know ...
McDonald 's .
' Because he needs to feng shui my soul .
' And you can 't argue with that . '
I love the conservatory , it 's great .
Hang on , hang on , who 's that ?
Hello ?
I think there 's some ...
Somebody 's talking .
Yeah , what do you want ?
Oh , they 've come to say hello , Warwick .
Hello .
Hello ?
Yeah ?
Do you know a John ?
John ?
No .
No ?
You don 't know a John ?
